= Ammitto UK Sanctions Data Repository

== Purpose

This repository stores downloaded and processed sanctions data from the
United Kingdom (UK) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI)
Consolidated List.

The data is maintained by the Ammitto project and used by the `ammitto` Ruby
gem for querying international sanctions information.

== Legal Basis

The UK sanctions are implemented through:

* The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA)
* The Sanctions (EU Exit) Regulations 2019
* Various country-specific sanctions regulations

Post-Brexit, the UK maintains its own autonomous sanctions regime separate
from the EU, though many designations initially mirrored EU listings.

== Data Source

* **Authority**: Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), HM Treasury
* **API Endpoint**: https://ofsistorage.blob.core.windows.net/publishlive/2022-04-06/ConList.xml
* **Format**: XML
* **Update Frequency**: As changes occur in UK sanctions regimes
* **Official Source**: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-consolidated-list-of-targets
