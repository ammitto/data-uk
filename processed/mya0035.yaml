  two days after the military seized power in a coup. \n \n The Chair of the UEC is
  responsible for overseeing activity relating to elections in Myanmar and the conduct
  of political parties. As Chair of the UEC U Thein Soe has been involved in undermining
  democracy in his attempts to override the democratic wishes of the people of Myanmar
  at the November 2020 polls, in particular on 27 July 2021 he passed a decree which
  annulled the November 2020 election results on the unsubstantiated grounds of widespread
  electoral fraud. \n \n Further and/or alternatively he is carrying out activities
  on behalf of the State Administration Council (designated under the Myanmar (Sanctions)
  Regulations 2021) and/or Min Aung Hlaing (the Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of
