uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nVladimir Vladimirovich YEZHIKOV is an \"involved person\"
  under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 because he is the so-called
  Acting Deputy Chairman (also known the Deputy Prime Minister) of the Russian-installed
  Government of the Donetsk People’s Republic, which controls the illegally annexed
  region of Donetsk in Ukraine. Through this role, YEZHIKOV is or has engaged in policies
  or actions which destabilise Ukraine and undermine or threaten the territorial integrity,
  sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.  \n"
