  The Quarter Master General Office (QMGO) sits within the Myanmar Ministry of Defence which is responsible for overseeing a campaign of violence and human rights violations across Myanmar, particularly in ethnic areas. Evidence indicates that the QMGO plays a crucial role in procuring equipment for the Myanmar Armed Forces, including ammunition, bombs and jet fuel. This directly enables serious human rights violations, and the repression of the civilian population including peaceful protestors and ethnic minorities. Further and/or alternatively, the QMGO is associated with the Commander-in-Chief (as Chief of the Armed Forces) who is a designated individual. The QMGO also works for the State Administration Council (SAC), as the SAC has control over the Ministry of Defence. In addition, the QMGO is intrinsically linked with Myanmar Economic Corporation, which is designated for funding serious human rights violations.
