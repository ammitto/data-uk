  The ownership of the entity was transferred contrary to the Ukrainian law. On 21 March 2014, the 'Presidium of the Parliament of Crimea' adopted a decision 'On the questions of creation of the Association of sanatoria and resorts' No 1767-6/14 declaring the appropriation of assets belonging to the resort 'Nizhnyaya Oreanda' on behalf of the 'Republic of Crimea'. The enterprise is thus effectively confiscated by the Crimean 'authorities'. Re-registered on 9 October 2014 as Federal State Budgetary Enterprise 'Sanatorium Nizhnyaya Oreanda' of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
