uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAliaksandr Astreika was the former Head of the Department
  of Internal Affairs of Brest Oblast Executive Committee and Major General of Police.
  \ In his former role as Department Head, Astreika was responsible for the actions
  of police officers in Brest, including those of the Criminal Police and Public Security
  Police (which includes the OMON riot police unit).  Astreika is therefore responsible
  for the serious human rights violations carried out by police officers in Brest
  following the election of 9 August 2020, in particular arbitrary arrests and ill‐treatment
  of peaceful demonstrators. \n"
