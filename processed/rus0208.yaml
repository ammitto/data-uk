  Commanding officer of the border patrol boat “Don” (side markings 353) of the Border Guard Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, 2nd rank captain. He was in command of the vessel that actively participated in actions of the Russian Federation against Ukrainian vessels and their crew on 25 November 2018 and conducted ramming of the estuary tug, “Yany Kapu”, of the Ukrainian Navy and thus actively contributed to the consolidation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
