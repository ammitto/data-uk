other_information: 'A DPRK-flagged tanker, SAM MA 2 owned by Korea Samma Shipping
  Company, conducted a ship-to-ship transfer of oil and fabricated documents in mid-October
  2017, loading almost 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in one transaction. The ship
  master was instructed to erase SAMMA SHIPPING and the Korean words found on the
  ship’s seal and instead put “Hai Xin You 606” to mask its identity as a DPRK vessel.
  IMO number: 5145892.'
