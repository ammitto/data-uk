uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n The Tatmadaw has a track record of committing serious
  human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law in Myanmar
  for decades. \n \nMiya Win International Ltd is responsible for ongoing activity
  in brokering deals for the supply and upkeep of aircraft for the Myanmar Air Force.
  Evidence indicates that Miya Win International Ltd has been involved this activity
  since at least 2017 and has continued to support the Myanmar Security Forces since
  the coup in February 2021. Miya Win International Ltd has therefore been involved
  in the supply of dual-use goods to the Myanmar Air Force; and has been involved
  in the supply of restricted goods which could contribute to serious human rights
  violations \n \nFurther and/or additionally Miya Win International Ltd contributed
  funds to the Myanmar Security Forces in 2017, at two fundraising events held by
  Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing during the Rakhine clearance operations. There
  are reasonable grounds to suspect that these funds contributed to serious human
  rights violations and ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.\n  \n"
