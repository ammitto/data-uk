uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nFormer so-called “Foreign Minister” and so-called ‘First
  deputy speaker’ of the ‘Parliament’ of the so called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’.
  Stood as a candidate in the so called illegal ‘elections’ of 2 November 2014 to
  the post of the Head of the so called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’. These elections
  are in breach of Ukrainian law and therefore illegal. In taking on and acting in
  this capacity, and in participating formally as a candidate in the illegal ‘elections’,
  he has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and to further destabilise Ukraine.
  Remains active in supporting separatist actions or policies. \n The trust services
  sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
