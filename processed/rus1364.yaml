uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nMajor General Valery FLYUSTIKOV is the Commander of the
  Special Operations Forces of the Russian Armed Forces. He is considered to have
  been either in direct command of and/or otherwise involved in deployment of Russian
  forces involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable
  grounds to suspect that FLYUSTIKOV is an involved person because he is responsible
  for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises
  Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence
  of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
