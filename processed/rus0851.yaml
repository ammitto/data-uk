uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Boris KOVALCHUK
  is associated with Yuri KOVALCHUK. Boris KOVALCHUK is the son of Yuri KOVALCHUK
  (RUS0007). \n \nYuri KOVALCHUK has been designated by the UK since 31 December 2020
  (updated 18/12/2021) and is a long-time acquaintance of President Putin. He is a
  co-founder of the so-called Ozero Dacha, a cooperative society bringing together
  an influential group of individuals around President Putin. He is the chairman and
  largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya, of which he owned around 38% in 2013, and which
  is considered the personal bank of Senior Officials of the Russian Federation. Since
  the illegal annexation of Crimea, Bank Rossiya has opened branches across Crimea
  and Sevastopol, thereby consolidating their integration into the Russian Federation.
  Furthermore, Bank Rossiya has important stakes in the National Media Group which
  in turn controls television stations which actively support the Russian government’s
  policies of destabilisation of Ukraine\n The trust services sanctions were imposed
  on 21/03/2023."
