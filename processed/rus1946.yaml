uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nState Prosecutor Anna Evgenievna POTYCHKO is an involved
  person under the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019. \n \nFirst, POTYCHKO
  was part of the prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Vladimir Kara-Murza,
  appearing in the Moscow City Court for the prosecution on 18 May 2022, arguing against
  the defence’s appeal from the order of the District Court to keep Kara-Murza in
  custody during the trial. Kara-Murza was subsequently found guilty of three charges,
  including disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under part
  2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news”
  laws.  \n \nPOTYCHKO was also involved in the criminal proceedings against Ilya
  Yashin under the same law, and made public comment regarding preventing Yashin from
  expressing anti-war views to journalists during those proceedings. \n \nThis law
  and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the
  Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth
  about the conflict in Ukraine. This policy prevents the spread of accurate information
  about the conflict in Ukraine, as well as anti-war sentiment and dissent, which
  would reduce public support for the war and undermine the Russian Government’s ability
  to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the
  war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and
  sovereignty.  \n \nPOTYCHKO’s involvement as part of the prosecution team in the
  criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, her appearance on behalf of the prosecution
  to oppose the appeal against preventative detention, and her involvement in and
  statement regarding the proceedings against Yashin demonstrate that she  is an involved
  person because she is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine
  and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. \n \nSecond, POTYCHKO
  is associated with an involved person, namely, Andrey Zadachin. Zadachin was designated
  by the UK Government on 21 April 2023 for his role as investigator in the criminal
  proceedings against Kara-Murza. Zadachin and POTYCHKO were both part of the prosecution
  team for the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, and therefore hold, or have
  held, a professional association. \n"
