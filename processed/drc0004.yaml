uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to conclude that KANYAMA
  was an “involved person” given that matters within reg (6)(2) occurred in Kinshasa
  while he was Kinshasa Police Commissioner and therefore bore responsibility for
  the human rights violations committed by the PNC. As Kinshasa Police Commissioner
  (PNC), Celestin KANYAMA was responsible for the disproportionate use of force and
  violent repression in Kinshasa. In this capacity, Celestin KANYAMA was therefore
  involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that constitute serious human
  rights violations and abuses in DRC. \n"
