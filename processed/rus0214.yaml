uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nCommander of the border partrol boat “Izumrud”, 3rd rank
  captain of the FSB Border Guard Service. He commanded the ship, which participated
  in the actions of the Russian Federation against Ukrainian ships and their crews
  on 25 November 2018. This includes actively participation in the blockade of tugboat
  “Yani Kapu”, firing on the ‘Berdyyansk’ and seizure of Ukrainian boats ‘Yani Kapu’,
  ‘Nikopol’ and ‘Berdyansk and detaining their crew.” and thus actively contributed
  to the consolidation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula into the
  Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of
  Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
