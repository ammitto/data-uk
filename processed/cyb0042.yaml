uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAndrey Stanislavovich KORINETS, a member of the Callisto
  Group (AKA Seaborgium, Star Blizzard, Cold River), is or has been involved in relevant
  cyber activity, including providing technical assistance that could contribute to
  relevant cyber activity. This included the preparation of spear-phishing campaigns
  and associated activity that resulted in unauthorised access and exfiltration of
  sensitive data. This action undermined, or was intended to undermine, the integrity,
  prosperity and security of UK organisations and more broadly, the UK government,
  and directly or indirectly caused, or was intended to cause, economic loss to, or
  prejudice to the commercial interests of, those affected by the activity.  \n  \nThe
  Callisto Group, a cyber programme operated by officers of the Russian FSB, was responsible
  for intrusions into the Institute for Statecraft (IfS), a UK-based think tank responsible
  for a programme to research, publicise, and counter the threat to European democracies
  from disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare. Official documents belonging
  to IfS were released in the hack and subsequent leak, resulting from the preparation
  of spear-phishing campaigns and associated activity. \n"
