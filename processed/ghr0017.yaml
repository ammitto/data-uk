  Andrey Pechegin was Deputy Head of the Division of Supervision of Investigations of the Prosecutor’s Office and he was responsible for the investigation of complaints about the ill-treatment of Sergei Magnitsky in detention. The evidence suggests that Pechegin intentionally or recklessly failed to fulfil that responsibility in that he ignored and denied complaints about the ill-treatment of Magnitsky.
