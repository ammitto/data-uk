  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that ING Dara (“ING”) is an involved person within the meaning of the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following ground: ING is or has been responsible for, engaging in, facilitating or providing support for human rights abuses. Specifically, ING is or has been involved in the operation of scam centres in Cambodia, including through the Jin Bei group of companies and Golden Fortune Resorts World Ltd. The treatment of individuals in these scam centres amounts to a serious abuse of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, and of the right to be free from slavery, not to be held in servitude or required to perform forced or compulsory labour.
