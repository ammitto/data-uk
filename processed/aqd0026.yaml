other_information: 'Associated with Al-Qaida (QDe.004). Brought Syrian and foreign
  Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115) and Asbat al-Ansar (QDe.007) fighters, along with other
  foreign Al-Qaida operatives, to join local elements in Syrian Arab Republic to carry
  out terrorist and guerrilla operations there. Previously associated with the Islamic
  State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115), and its
  leader Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai (QDi.299) but separated from
  that group in 2013. In Jul. 2016, Abu Mohammed Al-Jawlani (QDi.317), the leader
  of Al-Nusrah Front for the People of the Levant, announced the group had changed
  its name to Jabhat Fath al-Sham and was no longer affiliated with any external entity.
  Despite the announcement and attempts to distinguish itself from Al-Nusrah Front
  for the People of the Levant, the group remains aligned with Al-Qaida and continues
  to carry out terrorist operations under this new name. In January 2017, Al-Nusrah
  Front created Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a vehicle to advance its position in
  the Syrian insurgency and further its own goals as Al-Qaida’s affiliate in Syria.
  Previously listed between 30 May 2013 and 13 May 2014 as an aka of Al-Qaida in Iraq
  (QDe.115). Review pursuant to Security Council resolution 2268 (2017) was concluded
  on 15 November 2021. INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web link: https://www.interpol.int/en/notice/search/une/5790822'
