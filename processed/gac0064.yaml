uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAlejandro Eduardo Giammattei Falla (“Giammattei”) is an
  involved person within the meaning of the Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations
  2021 based on the following grounds: \n \n(1) Giammattei is or has been involved
  in serious corruption by profiting financially from serious corruption. As President
  of Guatemala, a foreign public official performing an executive function, he received
  a financial advantage to induce him to perform a public function improperly. He
  accepted a bribe from a Russian mining company in return for favourable exploration
  licences and port access. \n \n(2) Giammattei is or has been involved in serious
  corruption by being responsible for or engaging in serious corruption. During his
  campaign for the presidency of Guatemala, he bribed a foreign public official to
  induce the improper performance of a public function. He promised José Luis Benito
  Ruiz, then Minister of Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, a foreign public
  official holding an executive function, that he would continue his tenure after
  the election if Benito received illicit campaign contributions on Giammattei’s behalf.
  The reappointment was an advantage since it permitted Benito to continue improperly
  awarding construction contracts. \n \n(3) Giammattei is or has been involved in
  serious corruption by being responsible for or engaging in serious corruption. As
  President of Guatemala, he bribed a foreign public official for improperly performing
  a public function and intended to reward her for doing so. He secured the reappointment
  of María Consuelo Porras Argueta de Porres as Attorney General and Head of the Public
  Ministry (Ministerio Público), a foreign public official holding an executive or
  judicial position, in return for her undermining anti-corruption investigations
  into himself and other members of the Guatemalan political elite.\n"
