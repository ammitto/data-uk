uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nYevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin is or has been involved
  in\n activities which threaten the peace, stability and security of Libya or undermine
  its transition to a democratic, peaceful and independent country, through his responsibility
  and provision of support for the activities in Libya of the organisation known as
  the Wagner Group. The Wagner Group is a Russia-based private military company but
  its organisation is purposely opaque to obscure its ownership and \nin order to
  provide a deniable military capability for the Russian State. The Wagner Group is
  or has been operating in Libya\n in contravention of the United Nations arms embargo
  established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011) and, through
  its activities in Libya in support of Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army, threatens
  the peace, stability and security of Libya or undermines its transition to a democratic,
  peaceful and independent country.\n"
