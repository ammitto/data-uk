  Joint-stock company Lenpromtransproyekt participated in the project of connecting the railway infrastructures of the illegally annexed Crimea and Russia by designing the railway approaches to the bridge over the Kerch Strait and acting as a supervisor during construction of the bridge connecting Russia and the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula. Therefore, it supports the consolidation of the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
