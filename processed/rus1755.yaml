uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAlexei Gennadyevich DYUMIN is an involved person under
  the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“Russia Regulations”) because
  he i) is the regional Governor of Tula Oblast thereby meeting regulation 6(4a)(g)
  of the Russia Regulations; and ii) was previously working as Putin's chief security
  guard and continues to be associated with Putin, thereby meeting regulation 6(2)(d)
  of the Russia Regulations. Finally, iii) DYUMIN led the Russian military's Special
  Operations Forces, overseeing the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and in 2022 launched
  a drone training school for operatives undertaking missions in Ukraine, thereby
  meeting regulations 6(3)(a) and(b) of the Russia Regulations. \nAccordingly, there
  are reasonable grounds to suspect that DYUMIN has been involved and continues to
  be involved with destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.  \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
