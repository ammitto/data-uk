  Former "Minister of Education, Science Culture and Religion" of the so-called 'Lugansk People's Republic'. In taking on and acting in this capacity, Lapteva has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and further destabilised Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
