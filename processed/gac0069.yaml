  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Melvin Ernesto Quijivix Vega (“Quijivix”) is an involved person under the Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulation 2021 on the basis of the following ground: Quijivix is or has been involved in serious corruption by profiting financially or obtaining a benefit from serious corruption. During his tenure as President of the National Institute of Electrification (Instituto Nacional de Electrificación), when he was a foreign public official holding an executive or administrative position in Guatemala, he had a role in the grant or allocation of property and improperly diverted, granted or allocated that property, namely public funds, for his own benefit, to companies in which he held an interest, specifically Grupo Eda and MINE.
