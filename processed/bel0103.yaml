  Maksim Ryzhenkov is the First Deputy Head of the Administration of the President. In this role, Ryzhenkov has significant influence over the Belarusian authorities’ response to the post-election protests, including serious human rights violations, the repression of civil society or democratic opposition in Belarus and actions and policies or activities which undermine democracy or the rule of law in Belarus. Maksim Ryzhenkov also plays an important coordinating role over state bodies, including the working relationship between the President and the Belarusian Ministry of the Interior and its internal security forces, which are responsible for treatment amounting to serious human rights violations.
