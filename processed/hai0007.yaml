other_information: "Prophane Victor has long been involved in activities that threaten
  the peace, security, and stability of Haiti, as well as the entire region. In particular,
  he has been supporting and arming gangs, trafficking weapons, diverting government
  revenues, and using violence to secure his political and financial gains.  \n\n
  Prophane Victor served in the most recent National Assembly (2016-2020) where he
  was Member of Parliament (deputé) for Petite Riviere, Artibonite department, an
  area with increasing levels of violence and gang control. To secure his election
  as deputé in 2016 and his control over the area, Prophane Victor started arming
  young men in Petite Riviere who went on to form the Gran Grif gang, currently the
  main perpetrator of human rights abuses, including sexual violence, in the Artibonite
  department (see S/2023/674, para 75).  He is no longer a Member of Parliament and
  is not serving in any political position.     \n\nIn addition to securing his political
  foothold through the use of gangs, Victor is a former senior Customs officer and
  a businessman who has control over parts of the Customs department, allowing him
  to build wealth and enabling him to engage in a range of criminal activities with
  impunity.  According to reporting from January 2023, Victor threatened customs officers
  in their work.  \n\nVictor continued to support Gran Grif gang until 2020 and has
  since supported rival gangs in that area (see S/2023/674, para 75). "
