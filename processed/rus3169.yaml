  The Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to suspect that Andrej Anatolevich PALEVICH is an "involved person" under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 because he is, or has been, involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine by owning or controlling directly or indirectly (within the meaning of regulation 7), a person, other than an individual, which is making available economic  resources, goods or technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
