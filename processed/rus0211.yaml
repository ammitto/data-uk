  Head of the Service of the Kerch Control Point for the Republic of Crimea of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, 2nd rank captain. He participated in coordinating the actions of the Russian Federation forces against Ukrainian vessels and their crews on 25 November 2018 and thus actively contributed to the consolidation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
