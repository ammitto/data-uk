other_information: Al-Madani is listed for his involvement in and leadership of Houthi
  military campaigns that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Yemen thereby
  meeting the criteria for designation as laid out in Paragraph 17 of Resolution 2140
  (2014). Al-Madani is a prominent leader of Houthi forces and is the commander of
  forces in Hudaydah, Hajjah, Al Mahwit, and Raymah, Yemen. As of 2021, Al-Madani
  was assigned to the offensive targeting Marib. Persistent Houthi repositioning and
  other violations of the ceasefire provisions of the Hudaydah Agreement have destabilized
  a city that serves as a critical thoroughfare for humanitarian and essential commercial
  commodities. Additionally, there are regular reports of Houthi attacks impacting
  civilians and civilian infrastructure in and around Hudaydah, further exacerbating
  the situation for Yemenis facing some of the highest levels of humanitarian need
  in the country.
