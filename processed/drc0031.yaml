  Since 2010, Kakolele has been involved in activities apparently on behalf of the
  DRC government’s Programme de Stabilisation et Reconstruction des Zones Sortant
  des Conflits Armés (STAREC), including participation in a STAREC mission to Goma
  and Beni in March 2011. DRC authorities arrested him in December 2013 in Beni, North
  Kivu Province, for allegedly blocking the DDR process. He left the DRC and lived
  in Kenya for some time, before being called back by the DRC Government to assist
  them with the situation in the Territory of Beni. He was arrested in October 2015
  in the area of Mambasa for allegedly supporting a Mai Mai group, but no charges
  were brought and as of June 2016, he lived in Kinshasa. INTERPOL-UN Security Council
