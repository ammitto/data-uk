uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Admiral Nikolay YEVMENOV is the Commander-in-Chief of
  the Navy of the Russian Federation. A career soldier he has held many high-level
  commands in his rise to the top of the Navy. It is known that elements of the Russian
  Navy have been heavily involved in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia, including
  conducting missile strikes on cities and launching amphibious assaults. As the Naval
  Supreme Commander, Admiral YEVMENOV should have complete situational awareness and
  control over what his Navy does. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect
  that he is a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or
  promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens
  the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
