uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nMajor General Igor Yevgenyevich KONASHENKOV is a member
  of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, he currently holds the position of
  Head of the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Ministry of
  Defence of the Russian Federation. In this position he is used to heavily promote
  the Kremlin’s view of the war in Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds
  to suspect he is a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides support for,
  or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens
  the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.  \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
