other_information: "Luckson Elan, leader of the Gran Grif gang, has long been involved
  in activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Haiti, as well
  as the entire region.  His gang is the largest and most powerful in the Artibonite
  Department and has been expanding its territorial control, committing human rights
  abuses, and trafficking weapons and ammunition. \n\nOn February 8, 2023, members
  of the Coalition of Jean Denis self-defense group intercepted a vehicle coming from
  Port-au-Prince which was carrying several crates of arms and ammunition destined
  for the Gran Grif gang (see OHCHR report, “Criminal Violence Extends beyond Port-au-Prince,”
  Nov 2023).\n\nUnder Elan’s leadership, the human rights abuses and other crimes
  committed by the gang include extrajudicial killings, rape, recruitment of children,
  robbery, destruction of property, kidnapping, and hijacking of trucks.  For example,
  on November 30, 2023, Luckson Elan killed a woman for refusing to have sexual relations
  with him.  In April 2024, Gran Grif committed attacks on the judiciary by killing
  two lawyers. \n\nBetween October 2023 and January 2024, Gran Grif committed nine
  mass kidnappings, including 157 people.  Gran Grif has also committed some of the
  highest levels of child recruitment in Haiti. "
