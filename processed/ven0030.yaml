uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nSecond Vice President of the Supreme Court of Justice
  and former President of the Constitutional Chamber. As Vice President of the Supreme
  Court of Justice (TSJ), there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Mendoza Jover
  has been involved in repeatedly undermining democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela.
  The TSJ deprived the legitimate governing body, the National Assembly (AN), of its
  constitutional powers through several rulings, including through nullifying decisions
  of the National Assembly Board, nullifying the Democratic Transition Act, and stripping
  immunity from members of Parliament. Mendoza Jover has sat as a judge for these
  decisions, and bears responsibility for these grave attacks on democracy.  \n"
