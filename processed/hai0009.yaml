uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nViv Ansanm is a powerful and highly organized gang coalition
  operating in Port-au-Prince. Formed through the unification of several violent gangs,
  Viv Ansanm has played a central role in escalating violence and insecurity in the
  capital. The gang has significantly expanded its territorial control and operational
  capacity, contributing to widespread instability and undermining the rule of law.\n
  \nViv Ansanm has been responsible for serious human rights abuses and other criminal
  acts, including extrajudicial killings, kidnapping, extortion, and armed attacks
  on civilians and law enforcement. The gang has launched coordinated assaults on
  residential areas, particularly targeting neighbourhoods home to Haiti’s political
  and economic elite. These attacks have resulted in civilian deaths, mass displacement,
  and the destruction of property.\n \nThe gang’s activities have also severely disrupted
  public services and governance. Law enforcement operations have been repeatedly
  repelled by Viv Ansanm’s superior firepower and coordination. The gang’s influence
  has grown amid Haiti’s ongoing political crisis, and it is reported to have links
  with elements of the political elite, further exacerbating instability and blurring
  the lines between criminality and governance.\n \nViv Ansanm’s actions constitute
  a direct threat to the peace, security, and stability of Haiti. \n"
