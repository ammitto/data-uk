uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Integrity Technology Group Incorporated (Integrity Tech),
  formerly Beijing Integrity Technology Group (BITG), has been involved in relevant
  cyber activity, in that it provided support for and engaged in the commission, planning
  or preparation of such activity, and supplied technology that could contribute to
  the commission of relevant cyber activity. \n \nIntegrity Tech controlled and managed
  a botnet covert network consisting of over 260,000 compromised devices worldwide
  and supplied access to this network enabling unauthorised access to and interference
  with information systems and data which targeted UK public sector IT systems. \n
  \nSuch activity that Integrity Tech was involved in, undermined, or was intended
  to undermine, the integrity, prosperity or security of the United Kingdom or a country
  other than the United Kingdom. \n"
