uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nA Senior Political Commentator for the National State
  TV and Radio Company “Belteleradio” (BTRC) Andrey Evgenievich KRIVOSHEYEV is one
  of the most vocal and influential members of the Belarusian state propaganda machine
  in the broadcast media. Further, in his role as Head of the pro-regime State Union
  of Journalists (BUJ) KRIVOSHEYEV is a close supporter of President of Belarus, Alexander
  Lukashenko, and a key player in the regime's propaganda and censorship apparatus.
  KRIVOSHEYEV has actively supported Lukashenko and his regime throughout the flawed
  election process surrounding the 9 August 2020 Presidential election. \nKRIVOSHEYEV
  therefore is or has been involved in undermining the rule of law in Belarus and
  repressing of civil society and democratic opposition.  \n"
