uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs Commander of the Republican Guard until July 2020,
  Ilunga KAMPETE was responsible for the GR units deployed on the ground and involved
  in the disproportionate use of force and violent repression, in September 2016 in
  Kinshasa. In this capacity, Ilunga KAMPETE was therefore involved in planning, directing,
  or committing acts that constitute serious human rights violations in DRC.  Since
  July 2020, he remains a high-ranking soldier, as a Lieutenant General in the Congolese
  Armed Forces (FARDC) and Commander of the Kitona military base in the province of
  Kongo Central. There are reasonable grounds to conclude that KAMPETE is an “involved
  person” given that matters within reg (6)(2) occurred in Kinshasa while he was Commander
  of the Republic Guard and therefore bears responsibility for the human rights violations
  committed by the FARDC. \n"
