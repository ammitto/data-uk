  Appointed so-called “Prime Minister” of illegally-annexed Crimea in September 2019 and in this role undermined Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea. In his previous role as so-called Deputy Chair of the Council of Ministers of Crimea, his responsibility for implementing Russian federal programmes helped facilitate the integration of Crimea into Russia. In 2015 he was given an award for protecting the “Republic of Crimea”. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
