   JSC Tactical Missiles Corporation (TMC) is a Russian state-owned defence company and one of the most prominent manufacturers of missiles in Russia. TMC is a conglomerate specialising in aircraft and naval armaments, and recently announced they were developing new seaborne weapons, including a high-speed anti-ship missile with extended strike range. They have previously restored and developed coastal defence missile systems in Crimea after the illegal annexation of the region by Russia in 2014. Therefore TMC makes available economic resources, goods or technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. TMC also supports the Russian Government by carrying out business as a Russian Government-affiliated entity, which business is of economic significance to the Russian Government and is in a sector of strategic significance, specifically the Russian defence sector.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
