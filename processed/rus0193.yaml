  After the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russian National Commercial Bank (RNCB) became fully owned by the so-called 'Republic of Crimea'. In January 2016 became a property of Federal Agency for State Property Management also known as Rosimushchestvo. It has become the dominant player in the market, while it had no presence in Crimea before the annexation. By buying or taking over from branches of retreating banks operating in Crimea, RNBC supported materially and financially the actions of the Russian government to integrate Crimea into the Russian Federation, thus undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
