uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nColonel General Nikolay BOGDANOVSKY is a member of the
  Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, and currently holds the position of First
  Deputy Chief of the General Staff. BOGDANOVSKY is considered to have been either
  in direct command of and/or in a position to influence the deployment of troops
  involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds
  to suspect that BOGDANOVSKY is an involved person in that he is responsible for,
  engages in, provides support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises
  Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence
  of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
