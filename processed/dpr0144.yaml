other_information: 'Registered owner of DPRK tanker CHON MA SAN. DPRK-flagged CHON
  MA SAN prepared for likely ship-to-ship transfer operations in late January 2018.
  The master of the DPRK-flagged motor tanker YU JONG 2 reported on 18 November 2017
  to an unidentified DPRK-based controller that the vessel was avoiding a storm in
  advance of a ship-to-ship transfer. The master suggested that the YU JONG 2 load
  fuel oil before the DPRK-flagged tanker CHON MA SAN since the CHON MA SAN’s larger
  size was better suited to conduct ship-to-ship transfers in a storm. After the CHON
  MA SAN loaded fuel oil from a vessel, the YU JONG 2 loaded 1,168 kiloliters of fuel
  oil on 19 November 2017 through a ship-to-ship transfer operation. IMO number: 5936312.'
