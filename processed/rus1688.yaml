   Lieutenant General Alexander Semyonovich SANCHIK is an involved person under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Lieutenant General SANCHIK is a member of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. He has held the position of Commander of the 35th Combined Arms Army since 2020 and during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that Lieutenant General SANCHIK is an “involved person” per regulation 6(2)(a)(i) by “actively destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine” in that he works for the Government of Russia as a Lieutenant General of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, thereby fulfilling regulation 6(4A)(i).
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
