uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nOn 1 February 2021 the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw), led
  by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup and transferred powers to the
  State Administration Council (SAC).\n \nThe SAC is responsible for undermining democracy
  and the rule of law in its seizure of power from the democratically elected government.
  The Myanmar Security Forces, acting under the direction of the SAC and senior Generals,
  have committed serious human rights violations since 1 February 2021: killing protestors,
  restricting freedom of assembly and expression including through restricting internet
  access, arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the
  coup. The SAC has adopted legislation violating the right to privacy and the right
  not to be subject to arbitrary detention in Myanmar. As a member of the SAC, Htun
  Aung shares responsibility with its other members for the actions of the SAC. \n
  \nFurther, and/or alternatively, Htun Aung is a senior general in the Myanmar Air
  Force. He is also associated with Commander in Chief General Min Aung Hlaing who
  is a designated person under the Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021 and the Global
  Human Rights (Sanctions) Regulations 2020 in respect of actions related to the February
  2021 coup and serious human rights violations in Rakhine, and elsewhere. \nFurther,
  and/or alternatively, General Htun Aung is a Director of, and therefore associated
  with, Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd an entity designated under the
  Global Human Rights (Sanctions) Regulations and owned by the Myanmar military.\n
