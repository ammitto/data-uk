uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nDimitri Herard is a former Haitian police officer and
  head of the National Palace General Security Unit (USGPN). From 2017 to 2021, he
  engaged in actions that threatened the peace, security, and stability of Haiti.
  In particular, he was charged by the Haitian authorities for complicity in threatening
  the country’s national security, including the assassination of President Jovenel
  Moise and attempt to the life of the former First Lady, Martine Moise. Mr. Herard
  was arrested in July 2021. He escaped from the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince
  on 2 March 2024 and is currently wanted by the Haitian National Police (HNP) for
  a range of violent crimes that include homicide, burglary, rape, armed robbery,
  acts of terrorism and escape from prison.\n \nDimitri Herard represents one of the
  primary threats to both the political transition in Haiti, as well as to any future
  government. He has been supporting individuals sanctioned by the United Nations,-
  including Jimmy Chérizier (alias “Barbeque” – HTi.001); Johnson André (alias “Izo”
  – HTi.002) and Renel Destina (alias “Ti Lapli” – HTi.003), he has strong ties with
  some of the most violent gangs in Haiti and has been colluding with the Viv Ansanm
  alliance, as well as with Guy Philippe and other political, private and security
  actors with whom he is currently conspiring to seize control of the country by force.
  Mr. Herard is behind Viv Ansanm‘s coordinated attacks against State institutions
  that started in late February 2024, including planning the attacks and providing
  certain gangs with training and firearms. Since his escape from prison, Mr. Herard
  has sought refuge with the 5 Segond gang (led by Johnson André, alias “Izo” - HTi.002)
  in the Village de Dieu neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, and with Guy Philippe in
  Pestel, Grand’Anse department. \n \nDuring his service at the USGPN, Mr. Herard
  played a significant role in fuelling the trafficking of illicit arms and drug in
  the country by diverting HNP weapons, importing arms and ammunition illicitly from
  abroad, and moving drugs for criminal organizations in the region.\nDimitri Herard
  continues to be involved in significant criminal activities that have fuelled gang
  violence and instability across Haiti, including human rights violations and the
  obstruction of the delivery and distribution of, and access to, critical humanitarian
  assistance in the country. He was sanctioned by Canada for having committed acts
  that undermine the peace, security and stability of Haiti on 21 March 2025. He has
  provided logistical support to criminal gangs and political actors w\nho aim to
  overthrow the government and is also an associate of Izo, already sanctioned by
  Canada for reasons concerning serious and systemic human rights violations. \n"
