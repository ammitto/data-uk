  On 1 February 2021 the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup in Myanmar. As part of the coup, Vice-President Swe declared a state of emergency on 1 February transferring the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the state to Min Aung Hlaing. On 2 February, the Tatmadaw established the State Administration Council (SAC), which is chaired by Hlaing, in order to run the functions of the state. General Maung Maung Kyaw was appointed to the SAC on 2 February. The Myanmar security forces have committed serious human rights violations since 1 February 2021: killing a protestor, restricting freedom of assembly and expression including through restricting internet access, arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup. The SAC has adopted legislation violating the right to privacy and the right not to be subject to arbitrary detention in Myanmar. As a member of the SAC, Maung Maung Kyaw shares responsibility with its other members for the exercise of state functions since 2 February 2021, including legislation violating human rights, and for the serious human rights violations committed by the Myanmar security forces. As a member of the SAC, General Maung Maung Kyaw is associated with Commander in Chief General Min Aung Hlaing who is a designated person under the Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021 in respect of actions related to the February 2021 coup.
