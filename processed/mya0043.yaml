uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n  The Tatmadaw has a track record of committing serious
  human rights violations in Myanmar for decades.\n \nMyanmar Chemical and Machinery
  Co Ltd (MCM) has provided support for the military’s activities in its role as an
  importer and broker of arms imports to Myanmar. It has acted as a key source of
  weapons and commercial support for the junta. MCM, has therefore, been involved
  in the supply of restricted goods and/or restricted technology, which could have
  contributed to serious human rights violations. \n \nFurther and/or alternatively,
  MCM owned and/or controlled by and/or associated with Aung Hlaing Oo, who has played
  a personal role in brokering arms deals from Eastern Europe through his personal
  and commercial connections.\n  \n"
