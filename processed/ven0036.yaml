uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nNoriega is a National Assembly Deputy (2021-2025) having
  been re-elected on 6 December 2020 in undemocratic parliamentary elections not recognised
  as free and fair by the UK. Noriega had previously served as a National Assembly
  Deputy for the period 2016-2020. \n \nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that
  Noriega, a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly, has been involved in the
  repression of democratic opposition in Venezuela and other actions, policies, or
  activities which undermine democracy in Venezuela, by coming to power through fraudulent/illegitimate
  elections and by his involvement with Operation Alacran.  \n \nThere are also reasonable
  grounds to suspect he is associated with Nicolas Maduro, a person who is involved
  in the repression of democratic opposition and otherwise undermining democracy in
  Venezuela through his involvement in Operation Alacran. \n \nLastly, there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Noriega was acting on behalf of, or at the command of a
  person (Nicolas Maduro) who is involved in repression of political opposition and
  other policies which undermine democracy in Venezuela by aiding his attacks and
  attempts to control the National Assembly. In July 2020, Noriega, helped by the
  Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice (Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (TSJ)), illegitimately
  took over the leadership of the political party Voluntad Popular, thereby further
  undermining democracy in Venezuela. \n"
