  Vladimir Bogdanov is the head of the FSB's 'Special Technology Centre' (the parent entity of the FSB's Criminalistics Institute - Military Unit 34435). There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent and as head of the FSB's 'Special Technology Centre' Bogdanov has responsibility for, provided support for, or promoted the actions of the operatives who carried out the operation. Alternatively, he is associated with those who carried out the operation. Evidence suggests that Vladimir Bogdanov was in close contact with Stanislav Makshakov, the commander of the team of operatives involved in the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny. This designation is part of a further package of designations targeting the FSB operatives directly involved in carrying out the operation.
  Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.
  Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group).
  Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents.
  Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack.
