uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Abu Aqla Mohamed Kaikal is an involved person under the
  Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 because he is or has been responsible
  for, engaging in, providing support for, or promoting the commission of serious
  violations of international humanitarian law in Sudan, namely grave breaches such
  as violence against persons, specifically the Kanabi people, on the basis of their
  ethnicity or religious beliefs.  \n"
