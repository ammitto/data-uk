uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  \ngrounds to suspect that Alvaro Andres Quijano Becerra is an \ninvolved person
  under the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) \nRegulations 2020 because he is or has been
  responsible for \naction, policy or activity which threatens the peace, stability
  and \nsecurity of Sudan, namely through his involvement in enlisting \nColumbian
  mercenaries to fight alongside the RSF in areas of \nSudan, including El Fasher.
