uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nSergei Kuzhugetovich SHOIGU is Minister of Defence of
  the Russian Federation and a permanent member of the Russian Security Council (RSC).
  The RSC has been involved actively in decision-making about Russian policy towards
  Ukraine. On 21 February 2022, SHOIGU spoke in favour of a proposal to recognise
  Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics. As a member of the RSC, SHOIGU has
  therefore been responsible for, provided support to, or promoted a policy or action
  which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity,
  sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed
  on 21/03/2023."
