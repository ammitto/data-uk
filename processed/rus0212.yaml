uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nCommanding officer of the anti-submarine ship \"Suzdalets\"
  of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, 3rd rank captain. He commanded
  the ship, which participated in the actions of the Russian Federation against Ukrainian
  ships and their crews on 25 November 2018 and actively participated in the blockade
  and seizure of tugboat “Yani Kapu”, and armed gunboats “Nikopol” and “Berdyansk”,
  and thus actively contributed to the consolidation of the illegal annexation of
  the Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines
  the territorial integrity of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed
  on 21/03/2023."
