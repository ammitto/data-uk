uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Alexander Ponomarenko was elected in 2015 as a non-executive
  director of the Board of Directors of Sheremetyevo International Airport, the largest
  airport in Russia. He was subsequently elected as Chairman of the Board of Directors
  in 2016. He is reported to have a stake in the company which owns nearly 70% of
  the airport; the Russian State owns the remainder of the capital in the airport.
  Mr Ponomarenko also plays a strategic role in the running of the airport. \n \n
  Mr Ponomarenko has been a director in an entity carrying on business in a Government
  of Russia-affiliated entity, in a sector of strategic significance to the Government
  of Russia. He has therefore been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting
  the Government of Russia. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
