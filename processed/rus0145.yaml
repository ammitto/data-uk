uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nIn his capacity as Director General of OAO ‘VO TPE’ Sergey
  Topor-Gilka led the negotiations with Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies OOO on the
  purchase and delivery of the gas turbines for a power plant in Taman, Krasnodar
  region, Russian Federation. He was later, as Director General of OOO ’VO TPE’ responsible
  for the transfer of the gas turbines to Crimea and for the implementation of the
  construction project of the thermal power plants Balaklava and Tavricheskaya, where
  the turbines were installed. This contributed to establishing an independent power
  supply for Crimea and Sevastopol as a means of supporting their separation from
  Ukraine, and undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence
  of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
