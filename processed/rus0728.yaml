uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nSergei Borisovich IVANOV is a permanent member of the
  Russian Security Council (RSC) and Special Representative of the President for Environmental
  Protection, Ecology and Transport. The RSC has been involved actively in decision-making
  about Russian policy towards Ukraine. On 21 February 2022, the RSC supported a proposal
  to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics. IVANOV has therefore
  been responsible for, provided support to, or promoted a policy or action which
  destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty
  or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
