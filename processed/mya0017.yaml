uk_statement_of_reasons: |2-

  Following the coup against the democratically elected government by the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) on 31 January, General Mya Tun Oo was appointed Minister of Defence on 1 February. The Minister of Defence is responsible for the Tatmadaw, which includes the Army, Navy and Air Force. The Tatmadaw have committed serious human rights violations in Myanmar since 1 February 2021 including prohibiting freedom of assembly, the arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup, violence against protesters – including the use of water cannon and rubber and live ammunition - and preventing use of the internet. As the Minister of Defence, General Mya Tun Oo has command responsibility for these violations and can therefore be held responsible for these actions.
