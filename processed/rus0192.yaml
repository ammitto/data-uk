uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe ownership of the Massandra Winery, a business trading
  in Crimea, was transferred contrary to the Ukrainian law. The enterprise was confiscated
  by the Crimean ‘authorities’. The subsequent ‘sale’ of the entity to the Yuzhny
  Proyect Company (Southern Project Company), affiliated with the Rossiya Bank which
  was founded by Yury Kovalchuk, was therefore a further unlawful transfer. \n The
  trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
