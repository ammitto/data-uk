uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs former Inspector General of the Congolese National
  Police John NUMBI was notably involved in the campaign of violent intimidation carried
  out in the context of the March 2016 gubernatorial elections in the four ex-Katangan
  provinces, and as such is responsible for obstructing a consensual and peaceful
  solution with a view to holding elections in DRC. From July 2018 to July 2020, John
  NUMBI was Inspector-General of the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC).. Owing to his
  role, he bears responsibility for human rights violations committed by the FARDC
  during that period, such as disproportionate violence against illegal miners from
  June to July 2019 committed by FARDC troops under his direct authority. John NUMBI
  was therefore involved in planning, directing or committing acts that constitute
  serious human rights violations or abuses in the DRC. \n"
