  Alba Luz Ramos Vanegas is the President of Nicaragua’s Supreme Court of Justice, and sits on the National Council for Judicial Administration and Career. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that in her role as President of the Supreme Court of Justice she has undermined the independence of the judiciary, denying accused parties in the courts a free and fair trial, and permitting and actively encouraging cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment of accused parties. She is responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, repression of civil society and the democratic opposition and for human rights violations.
