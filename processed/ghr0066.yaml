  Ramzan Kadyrov’s leadership of the Chechen Republic in Russia has been characterised by the systematic persecution of critics of the Chechen authorities and of perceived subversives. This has included the systematic use of murder and CIDT against LGBT Chechens and human rights defenders. There is a considerable and credible body of evidence strongly indicating that the Terek Rapid Response Unit has been heavily involved in the murder and use of CIDT against LGBT Chechens since 2017.
