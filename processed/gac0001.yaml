  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of $230m of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. KUZNETSOV participated in the fraud through his involvement, in particular, in seizing documents used to secure the fraudulent tax rebate. He interfered in judicial processes and benefited financially from the proceeds of the serious corruption. His actions facilitated or provided support for serious corruption.
