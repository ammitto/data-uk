  Deputy to the Prosecutor-General of Tehran for Prison Affairs during the crackdown of 2009. As Deputy to the Prosecutor-General of Tehran for Prison Affairs he was responsible, by virtue of his senior position, for many of the arrest warrants against innocent, peaceful protesters and activists. Reports show that virtually all those arrested were held incommunicado without access to their lawyer or families, and without charge, for varying lengths of time. He was aware and complicit in allowing and promoting these human rights abuses and has made statements supporting excessive punishments and detentions of individuals, which appear arbitrary.
