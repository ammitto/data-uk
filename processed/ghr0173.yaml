  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Uni More Group Company Limited (“Uni More Group”) is an involved person within the meaning of the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following grounds: (1) Uni More Group is associated with persons who are or have been involved in human rights abuses, namely CHEN Zhi, Jin Bei, Golden Fortune Resorts World Ltd., and the Prince Group; (2) Uni More Group is or has been involved in providing goods or technology, knowing that they will contribute to a human rights abuse. Specifically, Uni More Group was involved in the development of Golden Fortune Science and Technology Park, a scam centre in Cambodia. The treatment of individuals in this scam centre amounts to a serious abuse of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, and of the right to be free from slavery, not to be held in servitude or required to perform compulsory labour.
