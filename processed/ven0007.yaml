uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nSectoral Vice President of the Economy and Minister of
  Petroleum, former Minister for National Industry. Reasonable grounds to suspect
  that as the former Vice President of Venezuela with oversight of the Bolivarian
  National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) El-Aissami is involved in the commission of
  serious human rights violations carried out by the organisation, including arbitrary
  detention, politically motivated investigations, inhumane and degrading treatment,
  and torture. Reasonable grounds to suspect he is also involved in supporting and
  implementing policies and activities which undermine democracy and the rule of law,
  including the prohibition of public demonstrations, and heading President Maduro's
  “anti-coup command” which has targeted civil society and the democratic opposition.
