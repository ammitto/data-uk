  Commander of the Central Military District. He is considered to have been in direct
  command of and/ or to have otherwise been involved in the deployment of Russian
  forces involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable
  grounds to suspect that he is a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides
  support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines
  or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
