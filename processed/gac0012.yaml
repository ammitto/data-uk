  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of $230m of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. KLYUEV participated in the fraud through his involvement, in particular in planning the fraud, and through his ownership of Universal Savings Bank. He was responsible for, and his actions facilitated or provided support for, the serious corruption. He also transferred or converted, or facilitated the transfer or conversion of, the proceeds of the serious corruption.
