uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Myanmar security forces have a track record of committing
  serious human rights violations and repression of the civilian population of Myanmar.
  International Gateways Group of Company Limited has been, and is, involved in (1)
  the repression of the civilian population in Myanmar,(2) the commission of serious
  human rights violations in Myanmar, and (3) other actions, policies and activities
  which threaten the peace, stability and security of Myanmar, through making available
  funds to or for the benefit of the Myanmar security forces. International Gateways
  Group of Company Limited is also an involved person because it is owned and controlled
  directly or indirectly by Mr Naing Htut Aung, a person who has been, and is, involved
  in (1) the repression of the civilian population in Myanmar, (2) the commission
  of serious human rights violations in Myanmar and (3) other actions, policies and
  activities which threaten the peace, stability or security of Myanmar, through being
  involved in the supply to Myanmar of restricted goods, including military aircraft.
  \nInternational Gateways Group of Companies Limited (IGG), a Myanmar-based company,
  contributed funds to the Myanmar Security Forces in 2017, at fundraising events
  for the Rakhine clearance operations held by Commander in Chief, Min Aung Hlaing.
  IGG has therefore made funds and economic resources available directly to or for
  the benefit of the Myanmar Security Forces, which could have contributed to serious
  human rights violations and repression of the civilian population in Myanmar.\n"
