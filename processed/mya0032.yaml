  The Myanmar military seized power from civilian leaders on 1 February in a coup d’état and established a military junta. The Myanmar security forces have committed serious human rights violations since 1 February 2021 and are responsible for the repression of the civilian population.
  The Directorate for Defence Industries (DDI) is a state-owned enterprise which operates under the Ministry of Defence (MOD). There are reasonable grounds to suspect that DDI is or has been involved in undermining democracy, the rule of law or good governance in Myanmar and the repression of the civilian population in Myanmar by its involvement in the supply to Myanmar of goods or technology which could contribute to a serious human rights violation or abuse.
  Further, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that DDI, as a state-owned enterprise subservient to the MOD, is acting on behalf or at the direction of the Minister of Defence, General Mya Tun Oo, who has been involved in undermining democracy, the rule of law or good governance in Myanmar and the repression of the civilian population in Myanmar, and is designated by the UK’s Myanmar sanctions regime.
