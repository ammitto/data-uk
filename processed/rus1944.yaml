  State Prosecutor Boris LOKTIONOV is an involved person under the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019. LOKTIONOV was lead state prosecutor in the politically motivated trial against Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was found guilty of three charges, which included that of disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under Part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, also known as the “fake news” law. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.  This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. LOKTIONOV’s role as lead state prosecutor in the trial of Kara-Murza, requesting a 25-year prison sentence for him, demonstrates his support for this policy. Therefore, LOKTIONOV is an involved person because he is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
