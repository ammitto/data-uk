uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Alexander Alexandrovich VOLOSOVIK is or has been involved
  in relevant cyber activity through his role in and association with MEDIA LAND LLC,
  an involved person identified as a key enabler of the cybercrime ecosystem.\nIn
  this capacity, VOLOSOVIK is or has been involved in the supply of goods or technology
  that could contribute to relevant cyber activity, or in providing financial services
  relating to such supply. VOLOSOVIK is therefore involved in enabling cybercrime.
  \nSuch activity that VOLOSOVIK is or has been involved in, directly or indirectly
  caused, or was intended to cause, economic loss to, or prejudice to the commercial
  interests of, those affected by the activity.\n"
