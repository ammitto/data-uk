  The Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Gedo Hamdan Ahmed is an involved person under the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 because he is or has been responsible for, engaging in, providing support for, or promoting the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sudan, such as the mass killings of civilians; ethnically targeted executions; sexual violence, including gang rape; abductions for ransom; widespread arbitrary detentions; and attacks on health facilities, medical staff and humanitarian workers.
