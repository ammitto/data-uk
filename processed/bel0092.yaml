  As a Judge of the Zavodsky district court in Minsk, Elena Nekrasova is responsible for the widespread sentencing of journalists, demonstrators and political activists in politically motivated decisions and without fair and transparent court proceedings. She therefore bears responsibility for undermining the rule of law and through her actions as a judge, she has contributed to the repression of civil society and democratic opposition.
