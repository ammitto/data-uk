uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nJSC 558 Aircraft Repair Plant (“558 ARP”) is a Belarusian
  defence company based at the Baranovichi airbase which provides maintenance and
  servicing to military aircraft. Belarus and Russia have deepened military cooperation
  at Baranovichi airbase in recent years and held extensive joint exercises there
  in February 2022, immediately before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There is evidence
  that Russian aircraft operated from Baranovichi airbase as part of the invasion.
  Given 558 ARP’s role in providing maintenance and servicing to aircraft stationed
  at Baranovichi airbase, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that 558 ARP is
  providing those services to Russian aircraft involved in the invasion of Ukraine,
  and therefore is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining or
  threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.
  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
