uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nLyudmila GLADKAYA is a propagandist of the Lukashenko
  regime. She is a journalist publishing in “Belarus Segodnya\", the official (state-owned)
  newspaper of the Presidential Administration. Her published opinions/articles and
  broadcasts are one of the main mouthpieces of state propaganda belittling and discrediting
  independent journalists and opposition supporters who seek to demonstrate evidence
  of serious human rights violations committed by the regime. There are recorded instances
  where she has interrogated persons and her journalism is specifically endorsed by
  the Lukashenko regime. \nGLADKAYA therefore is or has been involved in repressing
  civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus, and for serious human rights
  violations in Belarus.  \n"
