  We have reasonable grounds to suspect that Nazem AHMAD (“AHMAD”) is an involved person under reg. 6 of the Counter-Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on the basis of the following grounds: (1) AHMAD has been associated with an involved person, namely Hizballah; and (2) AHMAD has been involved in terrorist activity by providing financial services, or making available funds or economic resources, for the purposes of terrorism. We have reasonable grounds to suspect that at least the following entities are controlled by AHMAD, and are therefore also subject to the asset freeze on AHMAD: WHITE STAR DMCC (a UAE company), BEXLEY WAY GENERAL TRADING LLC (a UAE company), BEST DIAMOND HOUSE DMCC (a UAE company), SIERRA GEM DIAMONDS COMPANY NV (a Belgium company); PARK VENTURES SAL (a Lebanon company); and THE ARTUAL GALLERY (Beirut, Lebanon).
