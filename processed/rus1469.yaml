uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n There are reasonable grounds to suspect Volodymir Vasilyovich
  SALDO of participation in the establishment of the so-called ‘Salvation Committee
  for Peace and Order’ and therefore that he is or has been involved in providing
  support for and promoting policies and actions which destabilise Ukraine and undermine
  or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n
  The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
