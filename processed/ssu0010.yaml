  Gordon Koang BIEL is the County Commissioner for Koch, Unity State in South Sudan. BIEL is an involved person under The South Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 for commanding government-aligned militias/groups to carry out attacks in southern Unity State between February and May 2022, mobilising them to rape, abduct and kill civilians, loot civilian and humanitarian properties, cause forceful displacement of civilians, and use civilians as forced labour. This was done in violation of international humanitarian law and the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS).
