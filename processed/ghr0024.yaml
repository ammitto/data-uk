  Aleksey Krivoruchko, as a Judge at Moscow’s Tverskoi District Court, was involved in decisions to extend the detention of Sergei Magnitsky, and in particular on 14 September 2009, shortly before his death. In this capacity, Krivoruchko facilitated the mistreatment / denial of medical care to Sergei Magnitsky, which contributed significantly to his death.
