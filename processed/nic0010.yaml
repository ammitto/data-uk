  Ana Julia Guido Ochoa is the Attorney General of the Republic of Nicaragua. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that in her role as Attorney General, she has been actively involved in undermining the independence and competence of the Public Ministry; repressing political candidates, non-governmental organisations and journalists; and restricting access to free and fair trials, to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, and the right of all persons in Nicaragua to human rights regardless of their political views. She is responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, repression of civil society and the democratic opposition and for human rights violations.
