  Aelita Leonidovna MAMAKOVA is a key individual associated with the disinformation website SouthFront, and has provided financial services to maintain their operations. SouthFront is a website which has spread disinformation relating to Ukraine and promoted the Government of Russia’s false narrative about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Through her association and the provision of financial services to SouthFront, MAMAKOVA is therefore involved in supporting and promoting policies and actions which destabilise Ukraine and undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
