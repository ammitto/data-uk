  from the misappropriation of property when his company, Sakunda Holdings, redeemed
  Government of Zimbabwe Treasury Bills at up to ten times their official value. This
  meant that Sakunda Holdings and Tagwirei, as its CEO and owner, profited significantly
  at the expense of macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe. \n"
