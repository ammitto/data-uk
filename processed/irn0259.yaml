  The Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Law Enforcement Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran is an involved person under The Iran (Sanctions) Regulations 2023 on the basis of the following ground: The Law Enforcement Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran is or has been responsible for activity which amounts to a serious human rights violation or abuse in Iran, namely the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Specifically, during the January 2026 protests the Law Enforcement Forces engaged in, and provided support for, deadly crackdowns on protesters across Iran
