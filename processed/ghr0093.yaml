uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Konstantin
  KUDRYAVTSEV is an involved person under the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations
  2020 because he has been involved in activities that amount to a serious violation
  of an individual’s right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading
  treatment. As a member of the operational team that followed Vladimir Kara-Murza
  prior to two poisoning incidents, he facilitated the near-fatal poisonings.  \n"
