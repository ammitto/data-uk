other_information: 'The Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry was created in 2013 for
  the purpose of modernizing the DPRK’s atomic energy industry to increase the production
  of nuclear materials, improve their quality, and further develop an independent
  DPRK nuclear industry. As such, the MAEI is known to be a critical player in the
  DPRK’s development of nuclear weapons and is in charge of day-to-day operation of
  the country’s nuclear weapons program, and under it are other nuclear-related organizations.
  Under this ministry are a number of nuclear-related organizations and research centers,
  as well as two committees: an Isotope Application Committee and a Nuclear Energy
  Committee. The MAEI also directs a nuclear research center at Yongbyun, the site
  of the DPRK''s known plutonium facilities. Furthermore, in the 2015 Panel of Experts
  (POE) report, the POE stated that Ri Je-son, a former director of the GBAE who was
  designated by the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006) in 2009
  for engagement in or support for nuclear related programs, was appointed as head
  of the MAEI on April 9, 2014.'
