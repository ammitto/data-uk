uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nIn his capacity as Vice Prime Minister and Minister of
  Interior and Security from December 2014 to December 2016, Evariste BOSHAB was officially
  responsible for the police and security services and coordinating the work of provincial
  governors. In this capacity, he was responsible for arrests of activists and opposition
  members, as well as disproportionate use of force, including between September 2016
  and December 2016 in response to demonstrations in Kinshasa, which resulted in a
  large number of civilians being killed or injured by security services. There are
  reasonable grounds to conclude that BOSHAB was an “involved person” given that matters
  within reg (6)(2) occurred in Kinshasa while he was Minister of Interior and Security
  and therefore bore responsibility for the human rights violations committed by the
  security forces and police he commanded and influenced. It can therefore be inferred
  that Evariste BOSHAB was involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that
  constitute serious human rights violations in DRC. \n"
