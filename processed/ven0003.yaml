uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nNational Assembly (NA) (2021) Deputy for the Capital District
  and member of the NA’s Permanent Commission on Administration and Service. Chief
  of the Capital District (Distrito Capital) until January 2018. General Commander
  of the Bolivarian National Guard until 21 June 2017. There are reasonable grounds
  to suspect he has been involved in repression of civil society and democratic opposition
  in Venezuela and involved in the commission of serious human rights violations committed
  by the Bolivarian National Guard under his command. Further, there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that his actions and policies as General Commander of the Bolivarian
  National Guard, including the Bolivarian National Guard taking the lead in the policing
  of civilian demonstrations and publicly advocating that military courts should have
  jurisdiction over civilians, have undermined the rule of law in Venezuela. \n"
