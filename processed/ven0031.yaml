uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nDirector General of CONATEL, Minister of the Office of
  the Presidency, and a National Guard Brigadier General. As Director General of CONATEL,
  Venezuela’s telecommunications regulator, Marquez Monsalve has repeatedly repressed
  civil society and violated freedom of expression, thereby undermining democracy
  in Venezuela, by shutting down radio stations, blocking news portals online, and
  taking television channels off air. This has been done by CONATEL, led by Marquez
  Monsalve, in order to support the Maduro regime, stifle opposition, and hide corruption.
