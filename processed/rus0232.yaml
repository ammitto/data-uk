uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nBank “Rossiya” is a Russian bank privately owned by elite
  Russian billionaires with direct links to Putin. Bank “Rossiya” also has important
  stakes in the National Media Group, which controls television stations which actively
  support the Russian Government's policies of destabilisation in Ukraine. Since the
  annexation of Crimea, Bank “Rossiya” has opened branches across Crimea and Sevastopol,
  and provided travel cards for the public to travel across the peninsula thereby
  supporting the integration of Crimea and Sevastopol into the Russian Federation
  through the financial system. Bank “Rossiya” has also contributed to the provision
  of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol and services to support
  military capability and major transport links. Bank “Rossiya” therefore is or has
  been involved in providing financial services, or making available funds, economic
  resources, goods or technology and engaging in, providing support for, or promoting
  any policy or action that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining
  or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
