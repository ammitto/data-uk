uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Aleksandr Aleksandrovich SHULGIN (hereafter SHULGIN) is
  an “involved person” under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on
  the basis of the following ground: SHULGIN has been involved in obtaining a benefit
  from or supporting the Government of Russia as an executive director or equivalent
  of an entity, Ozon, which has been carrying on business in a sector of strategic
  significance to the Government of Russia, namely the information, communications
  and digital technologies sector. \n"
