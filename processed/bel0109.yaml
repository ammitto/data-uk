uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nJSC AGAT - Electromechanical Plant is named as one of
  a number of Belarusian defence companies on the website of the government authority,
  The State Authority for Military Industry of the Republic of Belarus (SAMI).  \nJSC
  AGAT – Electromechanical Plant manufactures the ‘Rubezh’ (Frontier), a barrier system
  designed for riot control which was deployed during the demonstrations that have
  taken place in the wake of the August 9 2020 Presidential elections in Belarus.
  \ JSC AGAT - Electromechanical Plant therefore provided support for, and made available
  equipment to police and security forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which
  have contributed to, the repression of civil society and of democratic opposition
  following the August 9 elections.    \nFurthermore, JSC AGAT - Electromechanical
  Plant is named as one of a number of Belarusian defence companies on the SAMI website.
  \ SAMI was established by the Belarusian President’s Decree of 30 December 2003
  and is described on its website as being “subordinate to the Council of Ministers
  of the Republic of Belarus and in certain aspects of its activity, in accordance
  with the current legislation, is subordinate to the President of the Republic of
  Belarus.” It is therefore reasonable to conclude that JSC AGAT - Electromechanical
  Plant is responsible for, engaging in, providing support for, and promoting the
  wider efforts directed by the Belarussian regime to repress civil society and the
  democratic opposition. \n"
