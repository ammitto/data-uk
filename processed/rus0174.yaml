uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Donetsk Republic is a public ‘organisation’ that presented
  candidates in the so-called ‘elections’ of the so- called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’
  on 2 November 2014. These ‘elections’ were in breach of Ukrainian law and therefore
  illegal. In participating formally in the illegal ‘elections’ it has therefore actively
  supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty
  and independence of Ukraine, and to further destabilise Ukraine. It was headed by
  Alexander ZAKHARCHENKO until his assassination in 2018 and was founded by Andriy
  PURGIN.  According to its website it is now under the chairmanship of Denis PUSHILIN,
  who is also the so-called Head of State of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic.
  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
