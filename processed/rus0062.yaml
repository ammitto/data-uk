uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nFormer so-called “Health Minister’ of the so called ‘Luhansk
  People's Republic’. Stood as a candidate in the so called ‘elections’ of 2 November
  2014 to the post of the ‘Head’ of the so called ‘Luhansk People's Republic’. These
  ‘elections’ are in breach of Ukrainian law and therefore illegal. In taking on and
  acting in this capacity, and in participating formally as a candidate in the illegal
  ‘elections’, she has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine
  the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and to further
  destabilised Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
