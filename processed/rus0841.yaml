uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n State Councillor of the Russian Federation, 1st Class
  Tatiana Viktorovna SHEVTSOVA is a Deputy Minister of Defence of the Armed Forces
  of the Russian Federation. She is considered to have directed, or otherwise have
  had involvement in, responsibility for or influence over the deployment of forces
  involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds
  to suspect that she is a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides support
  for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or
  threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n
  The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
