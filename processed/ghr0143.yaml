  to a serious violation of the right of individuals not to be subjected to cruel,
  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. \n \nSpecifically, during the protests
  that occurred following the announcement of the suspension of EU accession talks,
  the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia oversaw the police force's disproportionate
  use of violence against protestors.  \n"
