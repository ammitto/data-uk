uk_statement_of_reasons: |2

  Quren Salih Quren Al Qadhafi was the former Libyan ambassador to Chad under the regime of Muammar Qadhafi and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that he has been involved in activities carried out on behalf of the former regime of Muammar Qadhafi implementing or connected to the repressive policies of that regime through his involvement in the procurement and coordination of foreign armed mercenary personnel on behalf of that regime. There are reasonable grounds to suspect this involvement was in violation of the arms embargo imposed under paragraph 9 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970. In addition/in the alternative, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Quren Salih Quren Al Qadhafi’s alleged attempts to spread disinformation in Libya and opposition to the UN and UN-led political process in Libya threatens the peace, stability and security of Libya or which undermines its transition to a democratic, peaceful and independent country. In addition/in the alternative, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Quren Salih Quren Al Qadhafi is associated with Saif-al Islam Qadhafi and Saadi Qadhafi who are or have been involved in activities carried out on behalf of the former regime of Muammar Qadhafi implementing or connected to the repressive policies of that regime or any other activity which threatens the peace, stability and security of Libya or undermines its transition to a democratic, peaceful and independent country.
