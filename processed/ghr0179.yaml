  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that CHEN Zhi (“CHEN”) is an involved person within the meaning of the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following grounds: (1) CHEN is or has been responsible for, engaging in, facilitating or providing support for human rights abuses; (2) CHEN is or has been involved in providing financial services or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology, knowing or having reasonable cause to suspect that those financial services or funds will or may contribute to a human rights abuse; (3) CHEN is or has been involved in profiting financially from human rights abuses. Specifically, CHEN is or has been involved in the operation of scam centres in Cambodia, including through the Prince Group and Jin Bei groups of companies. The treatment of individuals in these scam centres amounts to a serious abuse of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and of the right to be free from slavery, not to be held in servitude or required to perform forced or compulsory labour.
