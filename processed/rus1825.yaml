  Christodolous VASSILIADES is an involved person under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 because VASSILIADES is associated with Alisher Usmanov, specifically through the professional services that VASSILIADES provides which benefit Usmanov. It is reasonable to suspect that VASSILIADES receives a benefit from the professional services he provides to Usmanov. Usmanov was designated by the UK Government on 3 March 2022, and is involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia. VASSILIADES is also director of Sberbank Investments Limited, a Cyprus based subsidiary 100% owned by PJSC Sberbank. PJSC Sberbank is a Russian bank owned by the Russian Ministry of Finance. Sberbank Investments Limited is therefore a company carrying on business as a Government of Russia-affiliated entity. Therefore, VASSILIADES is involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia.
