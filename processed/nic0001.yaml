  As Deputy Director General of the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) Francisco Diaz was de facto leader of the police forces during the wave of violence that began in Nicaragua in April 2018. Diaz was appointed Director General of the NNP in August 2018. In these two roles, he was responsible for orchestrating the repressive actions, violence, and acts of torture by the police and pro-government armed gangs against protesters, students and civil society members. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that he has been involved in serious human rights violations in Nicaragua.
