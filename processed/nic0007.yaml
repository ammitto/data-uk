uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nRosario MURILLO is the Vice President of Nicaragua, First
  Lady of Nicaragua, government spokesperson and leader of the Sandinista Youth. According
  to the President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, Rosario MURILLO shares power equally
  with him - the Constitution allows the President to delegate any duties to his Vice
  President. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that, in her position as Vice
  President, MURILLO had authority over and knowledge of: the state-backed repression
  of political demonstrations and activities; repression of civilians including through
  her leadership of the Sandinista Youth wing; and the discrediting of independent
  journalists and the exclusion of candidates from the electoral process. She is therefore
  responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, repression of civil society
  and the democratic opposition, and for human rights violations. \n"
