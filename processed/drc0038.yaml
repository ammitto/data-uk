other_information: 'Integrated in the FARDC in 2009 as a Lieutenant Colonel, brigade
  commander in FARDC Kimia II Ops, based in Ngungu area. In July 2009, Zimurinda was
  promoted to full Colonel and became FARDC Sector commander in Ngungu and subsequently
  in Kitchanga in FARDC Kimia II and Amani Leo Operations. Whereas Zimurinda did not
  appear in the 31 December 2010 DRC Presidential ordinance nominating high FARDC
  officers, Zimurinda de facto maintained his command position of FARDC 22nd sector
  in Kitchanga and wears the newly issued FARDC rank and uniform. In December 2010,
  recruitment activities carried out by elements under the command of Zimurinda were
  denounced in open source reports. Entered the Republic of Rwanda on 16 March 2013.
  As of late 2014, residing in Ngoma camp, Rwanda. INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special
