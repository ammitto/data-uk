uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nKempes Sanon, alias “Kempes”, is the leader of the Les
  Argentins gang (also known as the Bel Air gang), which has around 150 members. The
  gang’s stronghold is located in the Haut Bel-Air area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
  Kempes has been involved in various actions that threaten the peace, security, and
  stability of Haiti. In particular, he has engaged in systematic violations of human
  rights, firearms and ammunition trafficking, and supporting individuals designated
  by the United Nations Security Council, including Jimmy Chérizier (alias “Barbeque”
  - HTi.001). \n \nKempes Sanon has been playing a significant role in the consolidation
  of power by gangs over Port-au-Prince. Kempes was a founding member of the G-Pèp
  coalition, and has been playing a key role in enabling the growing hegemony of the
  Viv Ansanm alliance since February 2024. In particular, Kempes and his gang, along
  with Barbeque, the leader of the Delmas 6 gang and spokesperson of Viv Ansanm, conducted,
  in the course of several months, repeated assaults against the neighbourhood of
  Solino. Indiscriminate attacks against civilians and fighting with local self-defence
  groups resulted in many casualties and thousands of people having to flee their
  homes as a result of the extensive violence. Kempes and his allies eventually took
  full control of Solino in late October 2024 and, at the time of writing, are continuing
  to attack the last free bastions of Port-au-Prince, including Petion Ville and Haut-Delmas.
  \n \nKempes Sanon and his gang are involved in extorsion, illicit taxation and kidnappings.
  He has a network of people working for him within governmental institutions, including
  within security agencies, which allow him to avoid arrests, launder money and undertake
  kidnapping. \nKempes Sanon is wanted by the Haitian National Police (HNP) as he
  escaped prison in 2021 where he was incarcerated for kidnapping, theft and assassination.
  In September 2022, the Dominican Republic banned Kempes from entering their territory
  and, on 4 March 2025, they designated the “Haut Bel-Air gang” (Les Argentins) as
  a terrorist organisation. In May 2025, the United States designated Viv Ansanm as
  a foreign terrorist organisation.\n"
