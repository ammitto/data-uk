uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAlexander Lukashenko is the President of Belarus. He has
  held near absolute authority in his 26 years in power and maintains close control
  over the security apparatus of the State. This authority has remained in place since
  the 9 August 2020 Presidential election and he is ultimately responsible for the
  violence against protestors and journalists and the Lukashenko regime’s campaign
  to repress civil society and democratic opposition, and undermine the rule of law,
  that has followed the disputed election result in Belarus. Lukashenko has not called
  out violence and has expressed support for security services. Alexander Lukashenko
  has therefore been responsible for serious violations of human rights, the repression
  of civil society or democratic opposition in Belarus, or other actions, policies
  or activities which undermine democracy or the rule of law in Belarus following
  9 August 2020, and has been involved in promoting such activities. \n"
