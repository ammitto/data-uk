uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nVasilieu was Head of the Department of Internal Affairs
  of Gomel Oblast Executive Committee.  In his former role as Department Head, Vasilieu
  was responsible for the actions of police officers in Gomel, including the Public
  Security Police and OMON riot police.  Vasilieu therefore bears responsibility for
  the serious human rights violations carried out by police officers following the
  election of 9 August, in particular arbitrary arrests and ill‐treatment, including
  torture, of peaceful demonstrators. \n"
