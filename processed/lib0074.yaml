  The al-Kaniyat milita is designated on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the militia has committed serious human rights abuses and committed violations of international humanitarian law. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the al-Kaniyat militia was responsible for enforced disappearances, torture and killings which resulted in eight mass graves being uncovered in Tahouna. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the militia has been involved in activities that threatened the peace, stability, and security of Libya and undermined its transition to a democratic, peaceful and independent country.
