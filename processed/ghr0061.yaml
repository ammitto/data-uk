  Anwar Ahmed Khan (a.k.a. Rao Anwar Khan) is the former Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in Malir District, Pakistan. In his role as SSP Malir, Khan was responsible for numerous staged police encounters in which hundreds of individuals were extra-judicially killed by police, including the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud in 2018. Khan is therefore responsible for serious violations of the right to life.
