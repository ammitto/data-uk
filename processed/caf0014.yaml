other_information: Martin Koumtamadji founded the FDPC in 2005. He joined the Séléka
  coalition in December 2012 before leaving it in April 2013 after the rebels took
  power in Bangui. After being arrested in Cameroon, he was then transferred to Brazzaville
  in the Republic of Congo. He always remained in command of his troops on the ground
  in the CAR even when he was in Brazzaville before returning to the CAR (between
  November 2014 and 2019). The FDPC signed the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation
  in the CAR on 6 February 2019 but Martin Koumtamadji remains a threat to the peace,
  stability and security of the CAR. Ndjamena (since his arrest in November 2019)
