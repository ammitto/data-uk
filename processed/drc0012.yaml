uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs Vice Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior and
  Security between December 2016 and February 2018, Ramazani SHADARI was officially
  responsible for the police and security services and coordinating the work of provincial
  governors. In this capacity, he was responsible for the arrests of activists and
  opposition members, as well as brutality and excessive force used by the security
  services, such as the violent crackdown on members of the Bundu Dia Kongo (BDK)
  movement in Kongo Central; the repression in Kinshasa over January-February 2017;
  and disproportionate use of force and violent repression in Kasai provinces. Ramanzani
  SHADARI was therefore involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that constitute
  serious human rights violations and abuses in DRC. In February 2018, Ramzani SHADARi
  was named Permanent Secretary of the Parti du Peuple pour la reconstruction et la
  developpement (PPRD). \n"
