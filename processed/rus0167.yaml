  CJSC VAD is the main contractor for the construction of the Tavrida Highway in Crimea, the road over the Kerch Bridge and the access roads to it. Tavrida Highway will provide transportation access to Crimea through a system of newly constructed roadways that serve as a primary connection to the Kerch Bridge. Therefore CJSC VAD is supporting the consolidation of the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
