  Michael Makuei Leuth has held the position of Minister for Information and Broadcasting since 2013 and has been the public spokesman for the government delegation to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace talks. Makuei has obstructed the political process in South Sudan, in particular by obstructing the implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS) of August 2015 through inflammatory public statements and obstructing the work of the ARCSS Joint Monitoring Evaluation Committee and the establishment of the ARCSS Transitional Justice Institutions. He has also obstructed the operations of the UN's Regional Protection Force (RPF). Makuei is also responsible for serious violations of human rights, including restrictions on freedom of expression. Since the Revitalised ARCSS was signed (R-ARCSS) in September 2018, Makuei has continued to undermine the prospects for peace in South Sudan.
