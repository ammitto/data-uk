uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ángel Arnoldo
  Pineda Ávila (“Pineda”) is an involved person within the meaning of the Global Anti-Corruption
  Sanctions Regulations 2021 on the basis of the following grounds: \n \n(1) Pineda
  is or has been involved in serious corruption, by being responsible for or engaging
  in serious corruption. When Secretary of International Affairs and Cooperation at
  the Public Ministry (Ministerio Público, MP), a foreign public official performing
  an executive or administrative function, he received an advantage, namely his appointment
  as Secretary General of the MP. On accepting the advantage, he intended to improperly
  perform a public function. He has done so by intentionally undermining corruption
  investigations into the Guatemalan political elite and pursuing meritless legal
  challenges against journalists, judges and prosecutors who revealed endemic corruption
  in Guatemala.\n \n(2) Pineda is or has been involved in serious corruption, by being
  responsible for the investigation or prosecution of serious corruption and intentionally
  failing to fulfil that responsibility. When Secretary of International Affairs and
  Cooperation at the MP, a foreign public official performing an executive or administrative
  function, he received an advantage, namely his appointment as Secretary General
  of the MP. On accepting the advantage, he intended to improperly perform a public
  function. He has done so by intentionally undermining corruption investigations
  into the Guatemalan political elite and pursuing meritless legal challenges against
  journalists, judges and prosecutors who revealed endemic corruption in Guatemala.
  \n \n(3) Pineda is or has used threats or intimidation to interfere in a law enforcement
  or judicial process in connection with serious corruption. When Secretary of International
  Affairs and Cooperation at the MP, a foreign public official performing an executive
  or administrative function, he received an advantage, namely his appointment as
  Secretary General of the MP. On accepting the advantage, he intended to improperly
  perform a public function. He has done so by intentionally undermining corruption
  investigations into the Guatemalan political elite and pursuing meritless legal
  challenges against journalists, judges and prosecutors who revealed endemic corruption
  in Guatemala.\n"
