  DMITRI ALEKSEEVICH LEBEDEV, hereafter LEBEDEV, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors at Bank Rossiya and Managing Director and Co-Chairman of the Board of Management of ABR Management, and a member of Board of Directors of SOGAZ JSC, (both of whom are affiliates of Bank Rossiya), one of Russia's largest insurers. As Chairman of the Board of Directors at Bank Rossiya and a Member of the Board of Directors at SOGAZ, he is involved in carrying on business in a sector (financial services) of strategic significance to the Russian Government. Bank Rossiya is a Russian bank privately owned by elite Russian billionaires with direct links to Vladimir Putin. Since the annexation of Crimea, Bank Rossiya has opened branches across Crimea and Sevastopol, and provided travel cards for the public to travel across the peninsula thereby supporting the integration of Crimea and Sevastopol into the Russian Federation through the financial system. Bank Rossiya has also contributed to the provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol and services to support military capability and major transport links. SOGAZ JSC, the largest insurer in the Russian corporate sector, insured the construction of the railway infrastructure connecting the bridge over the Kerch Strait and the Port of Taman and reinsured the construction of the bridge over the Kerch Strait between the Russian mainland and the Crimean peninsula. In doing so, SOGAZ supported the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation which in turn further undermined the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. LEBEDEV therefore is involved in carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance to the Russian Government, has obtained a benefit from or is supporting the Russian Government by working as a director or equivalent of a company which carries on business in sectors of strategic significance (financial services) to the Government of Russia, and has supported activities which destabilise Ukraine and undermine and threaten its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
