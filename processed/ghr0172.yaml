  Heng Xin Real Estate Group (“HXRE”) is an involved person within the meaning of
  the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following
  grounds\n: (1): HXRE is associated with persons who are or have been involved in
  human rights abuses, namely CHEN Zhi, Prince Group, Jin Bei, ING Dara, and ZHU Jack;
  (2) HXRE has been responsible for, engaging in, facilitating or providing support
  for human rights abuses, specifically serious abuses of the right not to be subjected
  to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and of the right to be free
  from slavery, not to be held in servitude or required to perform forced or compulsory
  labour. Specifically, HXRE is involved in the development and operation of a scam
  centre in Cambodia. The treatment of individuals in this scam centre amounts to

  treatment or punishment, and of the right to be free from slavery, not to be held
  in servitude or required to perform compulsory labour. \n"
