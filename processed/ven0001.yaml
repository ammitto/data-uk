uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nCurrently Minister for Electrical Energy and Sectoral
  Vice President of Public Works and Services. There are reasonable grounds to suspect
  that Reverol Torres, as Interior Minister, was responsible for policing, and parts
  of the Venezuelan security forces.  Under the command of Reverol Torres as Interior
  Minister, the Bolivarian National Police committed serious human rights violations
  between April and July 2017, including excessive use of force by security forces,
  arbitrary arrest and detention, mistreatment and torture in detention, and over
  120 deaths between April and August 2017. Further, there are reasonable grounds
  to suspect that he was also involved in the commission of serious human rights violations
  as former Commander General of the Bolivian National Guard, including during “Liberation
  of the People” security operations against suspected gang-members in 2015. He was
  later promoted to General in Chief within the National Guard. \n"
