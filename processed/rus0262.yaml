uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nJSC Integral is a Belarusian defence SOE (state-owned
  enterprise) that produces semiconductors for military end-users, and supplies parts
  to both the Belarusian and Russian armed forces. Russian armed forces have been
  directly involved in the invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian armed forces have supported
  and enabled the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by conducting joint military
  exercises with Russian armed forces which involved the deployment of Russian troops
  along the border of Belarus with Ukraine, which in turn directly contributed to
  Russia’s ability to both threaten and attack Ukraine, including from positions in
  Belarus. JSC Integral therefore is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine
  and undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence
  of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
