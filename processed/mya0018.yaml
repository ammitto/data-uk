  On 1 February 2021 the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw), led by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup in Myanmar. As part of the coup, Vice-President Swe declared a state of emergency on 1 February transferring the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the state to Min Aung Hlaing. On 2 February, the Tatmadaw established the State Administration Council (SAC), which is chaired by Hlaing, in order to run the functions of the state. The SAC has adopted legislation violating the right to privacy and removing protection from arbitrary detention in Myanmar. The Myanmar security forces have committed serious human rights violations since 1 February 2021; killing a protestor, restricting freedom of assembly and of expression including through restricting internet access and of assembly, arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition leaders and opponents of the coup, and infringing.  As the Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw, Min Aung Hlaing has overall control of the Myanmar security forces and therefore has command responsibility for these violations. As a member of the SAC Hlaing shares responsibility with its other members for the exercise of state functions since 2 February 2021, including legislation violating human rights, and for the serious human rights violations committed by the Myanmar security forces.
