uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAndrei Nikolaevich MUKOVOZCHYK is a propagandist of the
  Lukashenko regime. He is a journalist publishing in “Belarus Segodnya\", the official
  (state-owned) newspaper of the Presidential Administration. His published opinions/articles
  are one of the main mouthpieces of state propaganda and include death threats against
  those who oppose the regime as well as belittling and discrediting independent journalists
  and opposition supporters who seek to demonstrate evidence of serious human rights
  violations committed by the regime. His journalism is specifically endorsed by the
  Lukashenko regime as it is the subject of several state sponsored awards. \nMUKOVOZCHYK
  therefore is or has been involved in repressing civil society and democratic opposition
  in Belarus and for serious human rights violations in Belarus.  \n"
