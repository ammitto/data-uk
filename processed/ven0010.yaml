uk_statement_of_reasons: |2-

  Vice President of Venezuela, acting Minister of Economy and Finance, former President of the illegitimate Constituent Assembly, and former member of the Presidential Commission for the illegitimate National Constituent Assembly. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that her actions on the Presidential Commission and then as President of the Constituent Assembly have undermined democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, including usurping the powers of the National Assembly and using them to target the opposition and prevent them taking part in the political process.
