  The Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front (İslami Büyükdoğu Akıncılar Cephesi in Turkish, IBDA-C) claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks during the 1990s and early 2000s, including an attack on the British Consulate in Istanbul in 2003 which killed the British Consul-General and 14 others. Their stated aim is to establish an Islamic federation in Turkey through violent means. The group is associated with Al-Qaida and has openly supported Osama bin Laden.
