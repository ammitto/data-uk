  Beltechexport is a key revenue stream for the military-industrial complex of Belarus with close ties to the Lukashenko regime. The ongoing financial and economic support of Beltechexport to the Belarusian state is helping to sustain the Lukashenko regime. Beltechexport therefore bears responsibility for supporting the Lukashenko regime and the human rights violations, undermining of democracy and repression of civil society carried out following the August 9 elections.
