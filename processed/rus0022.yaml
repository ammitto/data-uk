  Mr Malofeev is closely linked to Ukrainian separatists in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. He is a former employer of Mr Borodai, so-called Prime Minister of the so-called ‘Donetsk People's Republic’ and met with Mr Aksyonov, so-called Prime Minister of the so-called ‘Republic of Crimea’, during the period of the Crimean annexation process. The Ukrainian Government has opened a criminal investigation into his alleged material and financial support to separatists. In addition, he gave a number of public statements supporting the annexation of Crimea and the incorporation of Ukraine into Russia and notably stated in June 2014 that 'You can't incorporate the whole of Ukraine into Russia. The East (of Ukraine) maybe.' Therefore, Mr Malofeev is acting in support of the destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
