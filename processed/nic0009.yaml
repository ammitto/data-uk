  Fidel Antonio Moreno Briones has been the Secretary General of the Managua Mayor’s Office since 2007. He is also the Organisation Secretary of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). There are reasonable grounds to suspect that in his role as Secretary General he is responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, repression of civil society and the democratic opposition and for human rights violations.
