other_information: 'Former RCD-G General. Founder, National Congress for the People’s
  Defense, 2006; Senior Officer, Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-G), 1998-2006;
  Officer Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), 1992-1998. Laurent Nkunda was arrested by
  Rwandan authorities in Rwanda in January 2009 and replaced as the commander of the
  CNDP. Since then, he has been under house arrest in Kigali, Rwanda. DRC Government’s
  request to extradite Nkunda for crimes committed in eastern DRC has been refused
  by Rwanda. In 2010, Nkunda’s appeal for illegal detention was rejected by Rwandan
  court in Gisenyi, ruling that the matter should be examined by a military court.
  Nkunda’s lawyers appealed with the Rwandan Military Court. INTERPOL-UN Security
