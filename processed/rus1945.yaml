uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nDanila MIKHEEV is an involved person under the Russia
  (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019. MIKHEEV was the state prosecution’s \n“\nexpert\n”\n
  witness in the trial against Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was found guilty of three
  charges, including disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces
  under Section 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, also known as the
  “fake news” laws.  The enactment of this law and its application and enforcement
  by prosecutors and courts is a result of a Russian Government policy aimed at preventing
  the Russian public from knowing the truth about and intimidating those willing to
  criticise and provide accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine.  This
  policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine,
  as well as anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for
  the war and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this
  way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising
  Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Mikheev’s role
  as an \n“\nexpert\n”\n witness in the Kara-Murza case and another “fake news” case
  shows that he is providing support for this policy. Therefore, MIKHEEV is an involved
  person because he is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine
  and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n"
