  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Avrasya Shipping is a maritime company that has operated a vessel transporting military equipment to Libya in violation of the UN arms embargo established in UNSCR 1970 (2011). By assisting the contravention or circumvention UNSCR 1970 (2011), Avrasya Shipping was involved in an activity which threatens the peace, stability and security of Libya, and undermines its transition to a democratic, peaceful and independent country.
