uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nDong Lecheng is an involved person under the Global Human
  Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 because he is responsible for, has facilitated
  and has concealed evidence of activity that violates the right not to be subjected
  to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or the right not
  to be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.   \n \nSpecifically, there
  are reasonable grounds to suspect that Dong Lecheng, through his ownership and control
  of Golden Sun Sky Entertainment Co., Ltd. is involved in the entrapment of people
  and forcing them to working online scam operations in the Jinshui compounds in Sihanoukville,
  Cambodia.  \n"
