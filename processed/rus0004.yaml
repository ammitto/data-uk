uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs of 14 August 2014, he replaced Igor Strelkov/Girkin
  as the so-called ‘Defence minister’ of the ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’. He has reportedly
  commanded a division of separatist fighters in Donetsk since April 2014 and has
  promised to solve the strategic task of repelling Ukraine’s military aggression.
  Kononov has therefore supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Dismissed as so-called ‘Defence
  minister’ in October 2018. Chief of the Directorate for Social Assistance to Retired
  Servicemen, under the so called ‘Head of the Donetsk People’s Republic’. \n The
  trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
