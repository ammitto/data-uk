  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that QIU Wei Ren (“QIU”) is an involved person within the meaning of the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following grounds: (1) QIU is associated with persons who are or have been involved in human rights abuses, namely CHEN Zhi and the Prince Group; (2) QIU is acting on behalf of or at the direction of a person who is or has been involved in human rights abuses, namely CHEN Zhi. CHEN Zhi and the Prince Group are or have been involved in the operation of scam centres in Cambodia. The treatment of individuals in these scam centres amounts to a serious abuse of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, and of the right to be free from slavery, not to be held in servitude or required to perform compulsory labour.
