  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Basij Cooperative Foundation is an involved person under the Iran (Sanctions) Regulations 2023 as it has been involved in serious human rights violations in Iran, including providing financial services, or making available funds or economic resources that have contributed to serious human rights violations in Iran. The Basij Cooperative Foundation is associated with the Basij Resistance Force, an organisation that is involved in the commission of serious human rights violations.
