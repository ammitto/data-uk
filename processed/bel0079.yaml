  In his former leadership capacity as the Minister of Healthcare, Uladzimir Karanik was responsible for the use of healthcare services to repress peaceful protesters, including using ambulances to transport protesters in need of medical assistance to isolation wards rather than to hospitals. He made numerous public statements criticising the peaceful protests taking place in Belarus and supporting the authorities’ approach. In his current leadership position as the Governor of the Grodno/Hrodna Oblast Karanik continues to support the Lukashenka regime and presides over continuing human rights violations.
