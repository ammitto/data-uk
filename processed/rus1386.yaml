uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Pavel Nikolayevitch GUSEV is Editor-in-Chief of Moskovsky
  Komsomolets and is therefore responsible for the content of the newspaper. This
  newspaper has consistently supported and promoted the positions of the Russian Government
  on Ukraine, including engaging in active denial of the killing of civilians, most
  notably the massacre in Bucha. GUSEV, through the output of Moskovsky Komsomolets,
  has been involved in destabilising Ukraine, undermining, or threatening the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty, or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
