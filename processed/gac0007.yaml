  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of $230m of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. PAVLOV participated in the fraud through his involvement, in particular, in court processes based on fraudulent claims for damages, as the lawyer representing Rilend. His actions facilitated or provided support for the serious corruption.
