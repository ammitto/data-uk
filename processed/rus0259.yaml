uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs Deputy Minister of Defence for Armament and Chief of
  Armament of the Belarusian Armed Forces, Major General Sergei Simonenko is an active
  and senior military leader in Belarus and, as part of the top-level chain of command,
  is responsible for directing the actions of the Belarusian armed forces, which have
  supported and enabled Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Belarusian armed forces
  have conducted joint military exercises with Russian armed forces, and also consented
  to the deployment of Russian troops along the border of Belarus with Ukraine, which
  has directly contributed to Russia’s ability to both threaten and attack Ukraine,
  including from positions in Belarus. Simonenko therefore is or has been involved
  in destabilising Ukraine and undermining or threatening the territorial integrity,
  sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed
  on 21/03/2023."
