  As Head of the Judicial Support Directorate, Luis Alberto Perez Olivas is in charge of El Chipote prison. This detention centre has been identified as a place where serious human rights violations occurred and detainees were physically and psychologically tortured during the time Perez Olivas held that role. Therefore there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Perez Olivas has been involved in the violation of the right to freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In August 2018, he was promoted to the rank of Commissioner General in the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP).
