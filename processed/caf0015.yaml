other_information: 'Bi Sidi Souleman leads the Central African Republic (CAR)-based
  militia group Retour, Réclamation, Réhabilitation (3R) which has killed, tortured,
  raped, and displaced civilians and engaged in arms trafficking, illegal taxation
  activities, and warfare with other militias since its creation in 2015. Bi Sidi
  Souleman himself has also participated in torture. On 6 February 2019, 3R signed
  the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR but has engaged
  in acts violating the Agreement and remains a threat to the peace, stability and
  security of the CAR. For instance, on 21 May 2019, 3R killed 34 unarmed civilians
  in three villages, summarily executing adult males. Bi Sidi Souleman openly confirmed
  to a UN Entity that he had ordered 3R elements to the villages on the date of the
  attacks, but did not admit to giving the orders for 3R to kill. In December 2020,
  after having joined a coalition of armed groups established to disrupt the electoral
  process, Bi Sidi Souleman was reportedly killed during fighting. INTERPOL-UN Security
