  Major General Nyi Nyi Swe, former head of the Northern Command, oversaw military operations carried out in Kachin State between May 2016 and April 2018. In that context, he is responsible for serious human rights violations, the repression of the civilian population and actions that threaten the peace, stability or security of Myanmar committed in Kachin State by the Tatmadaw during his tenure. These include unlawful killings, sexual violence, forced detainment, forced labour, torture and ill treatment, and the systematic burning and clearing of civilian villages. He is also responsible for the obstruction of humanitarian relief to civilians in Kachin, in particular the blocking of food transports.
