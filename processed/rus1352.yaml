uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Rocket and Space Centre Progress JSC is a developer of
  space-related vehicles, complexes and systems. Rockets and satellites that have
  been developed by this entity are used by Russian military forces in their invasion
  of Ukraine and by the Russian state to show support for their invasion. They have
  therefore contributed to the destabilising of Ukraine and have undermined or threatened
  the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
