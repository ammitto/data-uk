uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Myanmar War Veterans Organisation (MWVO) is associated
  with the Tatmadaw which is responsible for serious human rights violations against
  the population of Myanmar; undermining democracy and repressing the civilian population,
  in particular during the 2021 coup d'etat and violence against ethnic minorities.
  The MWVO functions in part as a reserve force for the Tatmadaw and helps shape national
  defence and security policy. Several high-ranking serving Tatmadaw officers sit
  on the Central Patron Board. In particular the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief
  of the Defence Services, both of whom have been involved in serious human rights
  violations (and designated under the Global Human Rights sanctions regulations)
  sit on the Central Patron Board of the MWVO. Further or alternatively, the MWVO
  has promoted and supported the Tatmadaw’s involvement in undermining democracy;
  violating human rights; and repressing the civilian population. The MWVO organises
  pro-regime rallies in support of, and to counter international condemnation of the
  Tatmadaw; and practises people’s militia. Further or alternatively, MWVO is also
  associated with Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL), a designated entity, through
  a shared governance structure and financial relationship.  \n"
