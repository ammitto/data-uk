  Following the coup of 1 February 2021, during which Myanmar’s military seized power from civilian leaders, Than Hlaing was appointed Deputy Minister for Home Affairs and Chief of the Myanmar Police Force. The police in Myanmar have committed serious human rights violations since 1 February 2021 including killing a civilian protestor against the coup, preventing and disbanding assemblies, the arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition leaders and supporters, and preventing freedom of expression by opponents of the coup. As Deputy Minister for Home Affairs and Chief of the Myanmar Police Force we have strong reason to suspect that Lt. General Than Hlaing has command responsibility for these serious human rights violations.
