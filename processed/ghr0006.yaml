  Fikret Tagiyev was the head of the Matrosskaya Tishina detention centre where Sergei Magnitsky died on 16 November 2009. He was responsible for the mistreatment of Sergei Magnitsky whilst in detention, which contributed significantly to his death including by failing to ensure the provision of adequate medical treatment, ordering the handcuffing and beating of Magnitsky shortly before his death and denying, or failing to provide, timely access for emergency services to provide treatment. Tagiyev was also involved in the concealment of evidence regarding the circumstances relating to Magnitsky’s death.
