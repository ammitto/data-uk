  The Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that AEZA GROUP LLC is an “involved person” under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on the basis of the following ground: AEZA GROUP LLC is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine by making available technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine through the provision of “bulletproof hosting services” to the Social Design Agency (SDA).
