  Advisor to Iran's High Council for Human Rights. Former secretary of the High Council for Human Rights. Former governor of Ilam Province. Former Interior Ministry's political director. As Head of the Article 10 Committee of the Law on Activities of Political Parties and Groups he was in charge of authorising demonstrations and other public events and registering political parties. In 2010, he suspended the activities of two reformist political parties linked to Mousavi — the Islamic Iran Participation Front and the Islamic Revolution Mujahedeen Organisation. From 2009 onwards he has consistently and continuously prohibited all non-governmental gatherings, therefore denying a constitutional right to protest and leading to many arrests of peaceful demonstrators in contravention of the right to freedom of assembly. He also denied in 2009 the opposition a permit for a ceremony to mourn people killed in protests over the Presidential elections.
