  Mohamed al-Kani is designated on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that he was head of the Al-Kaniyat militia and involved in the activities of the militia in Tarhuna, including in serious human rights abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law. Under the leadership of Mohamed al-Kani, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the al-Kaniyat militia was responsible for enforced disappearances, torture and killings which resulted in eight mass graves being uncovered in Tarhouna. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that he is involved in the activities of the militia and that those activities threatened the peace, stability, and security of Libya and undermined its transition to a democratic, peaceful and independent country.
