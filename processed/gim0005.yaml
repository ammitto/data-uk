  GANG is responsible for, is involved in the facilitation of, and profits financially
  from, people smuggling, in the form of unlawful arrival into a country of a person
  who is not a national of that country or permanently resident in it. Namely, THE
  KAZAWI GANG is a highly professional, hierarchical network that spans multiple countries

  against migrants who cannot meet their costs. \n"
