  Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, as Head of the ‘Commission to Determine the Instances of Criminal Content’, is or has been involved in a governmental organization in charge of online censorship and cyber crime. Under his leadership the Commission defined ‘cybercrime’ by a number of vague categories that criminalize creation and publication of content deemed inappropriate by the regime. He is responsible for repression and the blocking of numerous opposition sites, electronic newspapers, blogs, sites of human rights NGOs and of Google and Gmail since September 2012. He and the Commission actively contributed to the death in detention of the blogger Sattar Beheshti in November 2012. Thus the Commission is directly responsible for systemic violations of human rights, in particular by banning and filtering websites to the general public, and occasionally disabling Internet access altogether.
