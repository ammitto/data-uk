  Yelena Stashina, as a Judge at Moscow’s Tverskoi District Court, was involved in decisions to extend the detention of Sergei Magnitsky, and in particular on 12 November 2009, four days before his death. In this capacity, Stashina facilitated the mistreatment / denial of medical care to Sergei Magnitsky which contributed significantly to his death.
