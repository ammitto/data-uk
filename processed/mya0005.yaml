  Brigadier General Thant Zin Oo was Commander of the paramilitary 8th Security Police Battalion of the Myanmar Army during August and September 2017. As commander, he was responsible for the actions of the 8th Security Police Battalion under his command and therefore responsible for serious human rights violations committed against the Rohingya population in Rakhine state by the 8th Security Police Battalion. These include unlawful killings, repression of the civilian population and systematic burning of Rohingya houses and buildings.
