  Razvozhaev was appointed as acting “Governor of Sevastopol” by President Putin in July 2019. In this capacity, he has worked for further integration of the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, including involvement in Russian-organised illegal local elections, and is as such responsible for actively supporting or implementing actions or policies which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
