uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nVinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, also known as Colonel Karuna
  Amman, is an involved person within the meaning of the Global Human Rights Sanctions
  Regulations 2020 on the basis that he has been and remains responsible for an activity
  that amounts to serious violations and abuses of an individual's right to life and
  right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
  punishment. \nSpecifically, LTTE forces and a breakaway pro-government fraction
  of the LTTE ‘Karuna Group’, under Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan’s command, were directly
  involved in illegal killings and torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
  or punishment, during Sri Lanka’s 26-year-long armed conflict.  \n"
