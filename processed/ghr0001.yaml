  Dmitry Borisovich Kratov, who was the chief medical officer and deputy head of Butyrka Prison where Magnitsky was detained until shortly before his death on 16 November 2009, was responsible for the mistreatment of Sergei Magnitsky, including by failing to ensure the proper administration of medical care, which contributed significantly to his death.
