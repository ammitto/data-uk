other_information: 'ADF founder and leader, Jamil Mukulu (CDi.015), was arrested in
  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in April 2015. He was subsequently extradited to Kampala,
  Uganda in July 2015. As of June 2016, Mukulu is reportedly being held in a police
  detention cell awaiting his trial. Seka Baluku (CDi.036) succeeded Jamil Mukulu
  (CDi.015) as the overall leader of the ADF. As highlighted in several reports from
  the Group of Experts on the DRC (S/2015/19, S/2015/797, S/2016/1102, S/2017/672,
  S/2018/531, S/2019/469, S/2019/974, S/2020/482), the ADF, including under Seka Baluku’s
  leadership, continued to commit the repeated targeting, killing and maiming, rape
  and other sexual violence, abduction of civilians, including children, as well as
  attacks on villages and health facilities, in particular in Mamove, Beni territory,
  on 12 and 24 February 2019, and Mantumbi, Beni territory, on 5 December 2019 and
  30 January 2020, as well as the continuous recruitment and use of children during
  attacks and for forced labour in Beni territory in the DRC since at least 2015.
