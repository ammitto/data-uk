  Boris Borisovich Kibis was an investigator at the Russian Interior Ministry in 2012, at the time of the posthumous trial of Sergei Magnitsky. In this role, he concealed evidence relating to the mistreatment of Magnitsky, which contributed significantly to his death on 16 November 2009, by supporting the actions of his predecessor Oleg Silchenko and the ‘team’ of investigators who were involved in that conduct.
