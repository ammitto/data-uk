  Anatol Vasilieu is Deputy Head of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Gomel Regional Executive Committee and head of the Public Security Police. In this role Vasilieu bears responsibility for the actions of police officers in Gomel. Vasiliev is therefore responsible for the serious human rights violations carried out by police officers in that region following the election of 9 August, in particular arbitrary arrests and ill‐treatment, including torture, of peaceful demonstrators.
