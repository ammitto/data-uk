  As Prosecutor of Mazandaran Province, Jafari has recommended the imposition of the death penalty in cases he has prosecuted, which has resulted in many executions including public executions and in circumstances where the imposition of the death penalty is contrary to international human rights, including by being disproportionate and excessive punishment. As Head of Judicial Administration in North Khorasan province, Jafari has also participated in the suppression of protesters and violated their rights including to a fair trial, freedom of assembly, and freedom of expression. Jafari has also been responsible for illegal arrests and violations of the rights of Baha'i detainees from initial arrest to keeping them in solitary confinement in the Intelligence Detention Centre.
