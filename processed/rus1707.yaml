   OBORONLOGISTICS LLC is an involved person under the Russian (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019. OBORONLOGISTICS LLC is a Russian Ministry of Defence owned and controlled shipping and logistics company. The main objectives of the company are to guarantee the needs of the Ministry of Defence of Russia regarding transportation, storage and production of military and special purpose goods. OBORONLOGISTICS LLC ships are believed to have been used to transport surface-to-air missiles from Syria to the Black Sea to be used in Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that OBORONLOGISTICS LLC satisfies regulation 6(2)(a)(i) on the basis that it is an involved entity that provides support for any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. It also falls within Regulation 6(2)(a)(ii) on the basis that it is obtaining a benefit from and/or supporting the Government of Russia by carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance to the Government of Russia (namely the Russian defence sector).
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
