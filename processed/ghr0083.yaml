  Dmitry Kovtun is a former member of the Russian military. He was one of the two individuals found to be responsible by the Litvinenko Inquiry for the killing of Alexander Litvinenko through deliberate poisoning with polonium 210 in November 2006. This action constitutes a serious violation of the right to life. It is probable that this action was carried out under the direction of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB).
