  Member of the State Duma, elected from the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Former “First Deputy Prime Minister” of Crimea. Sheremet played a key role in the organisation and implementation of the 16 March referendum in Crimea on unification with Russia. At the time of the referendum, Sheremet reportedly commanded the pro-Moscow “self-defence forces” in Crimea. He has therefore supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Elected on 18 September 2016 as a Duma deputy from illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
