  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of $230m of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. STEPANOVA participated in the serious corruption through her approval of part of the fraudulent tax rebate. She was responsible for and her actions facilitated or provided support for the serious corruption. She transferred or converted, or facilitated the transfer or conversion of, the proceeds of the serious corruption and benefitted financially from the serious corruption.
