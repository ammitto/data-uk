  a co-operative society bringing together an influential group of individuals around
  President Putin.  He is a significant shareholder of Bank Rossiya. Since the annexation
  of Crimea, Bank Rossiya has opened branches across Crimea and Sevastopol, thereby
  consolidating their integration into the Russian Federation. It also has important
  stakes in the National Media Group, which controls television stations which actively
  support the Russian Government's policies of destabiliation in Ukraine. It has contributed
  to the provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopal and
  services to support military capability and major transport links. \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
