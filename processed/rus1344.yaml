uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nGeneral of the Army Sergei Borisovich KOROLYOV is a military
  official of the Russian Federation, he currently holds the position of First Deputy
  Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) of the Russian Federation. He is
  considered to be or have been either in direct command of or in a position to hold
  considerable situational awareness of operatives involved in the Russian invasion
  of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect he is a person who
  is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes any policy or
