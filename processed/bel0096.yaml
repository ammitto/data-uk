uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nIn his position as Minister of Defence of Belarus since
  20 January 2020, Viktor Khrenin is responsible for the decision taken by the Command
  of the Air Forces and Air Defence Forces for the order dispatching military aircraft
  to intercept passenger flight FR4978 and compel its landing at Minsk airport, without
  proper justification, on 23 May 2021. In doing so, Khrenin acted at the direction
  of Alexander Lukashenko and in conjunction with the Belarusian aviation authorities.
  This resulted in the forced redirection of flight FR4978, the detention of the aircraft,
  its passengers and the crew, and the arrest of opposition journalist and civil society
  actor Roman Protasevich and Protasevich’s partner, Sofia Sapega. This politically
  motivated decision was aimed at arresting and detaining opposition journalist Protasevich
  and Sapega and constitutes a form of repression against civil society and democratic
  opposition in Belarus. \nViktor Khrenin is therefore responsible for the repression
  of civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus and so undermined democracy
  and the rule of law there. \n"
