  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of US$ 230 million of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. KARPOV participated in the fraud through his role as an investigator of alleged tax fraud by the Kameya company. His actions facilitated or provided support for serious corruption, and he benefited financially from the proceeds of the serious corruption.
