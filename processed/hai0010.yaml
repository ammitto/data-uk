uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Gran Griff gang, also known as the Savien gang, is
  the largest and most powerful gang in the Artibonite department. Over the past two
  years, the gang has been substantially expanding its territorial control, committing
  serious violations of human rights law, and trafficking weapons and ammunition.
  The violence is causing people to flee the area and is having an increasingly serious
  impact on food production, given that the Artibonite is one of the main agricultural
  departments in the country. \n \nHuman rights abuses and other serious crimes committed
  by the gang include extrajudicial killings, rape – including gang rape of children
  cruel and degrading treatment, robbery, destruction of property, kidnapping, and
  hijacking of trucks. \nThe gang’s activities have also severely disrupted health
  services and law enforcement in the area. In particular, the gang has targeted the
  National Police on several occasions resulting in the death of seven police officers
  following an attack on 25 January 2023, and the occupation of a local police station
  in Savien, Petite Riviere commune.\n"
