  The ownership of the entity was transferred contrary to the Ukrainian law. On 17.3.2014 the ‘Parliament of Crimea’ adopted a resolution No 1757-6/14 ‘On nationalization of some companies belonging to the Ukrainian ministries of infrastructure of agriculture’ declaring the appropriation of assets belonging to the state enterprise ‘Sevastopol commercial seaport’ on behalf of the ‘Republic of Crimea’. The enterprise is thus effectively confiscated by the Crimean ‘authorities’. In terms of volume of trade, it is the biggest commercial seaport in Crimea. Re-registered on 6.6.2014 as State Unitary Enterprise of the City of Sevastopol ‘Sevastopol seaport’. This undermined the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
