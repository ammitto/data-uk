  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Venezuelan Prosecutor Farik Karin Mora Salcedo has engaged in conduct relevant to a listing under the following criteria: (a) natural persons responsible for serious human rights violations or abuses or the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Venezuela. (b) natural persons whose action, policies or activities otherwise undermine democracy or the rule of law in Venezuela. There is reliable evidence that Mora is directly responsible for issuing the arbitrary arrests of Parliamentarians, with Parliamentary Immunity. There is a considerable amount of diverse evidence reporting Mora as the prosecutor for at least four people with Parliamentary Immunity – Requesens, Borges, Alban, and Marrero, making him responsible by virtue of his position for undermining democracy and the rule of law, and repressing democratic opposition. Mora was the prosecutor for the case of Fernando Alban, where the defendant died under suspicious circumstances. There is reliable evidence that Mora participated in Alban’s autopsy, saw visible signs of torture, and announced an incorrect cause of death to cover this up. According to multiple allegations, some first-hand accounts, he has been witness to the torture of multiple prisoners, some of whom he was prosecutor for. There are thus reasonable grounds to suspect that Mora consented or acquiesced to such acts, and therefore bears responsibility for the serious human rights violation of torture.
