uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nFranklyn Duarte is a National Assembly Deputy (2021-2025)
  having been re-elected on 6 December 2020 in undemocratic parliamentary elections
  not recognised as free and fair by the UK. Duarte had previously served as a National
  Assembly Deputy for the period 20156-2020. \n \nAs a Deputy of the 2015-2020 National
  Assembly Deputy, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Franklin Duarte has
  been involved in the repression of democratic opposition and other actions, policies,
  or activities which undermine democracy in Venezuela by coming to power through
  fraudulent/illegitimate elections for the new National Assembly Board on 5 January
  2020 and through his involvement with Operation Alacran.  \n \nThere are also reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Duarte has been acting on behalf of, or at the direction
  of, a person (Nicolas Maduro) who is involved in repression of political opposition
  and other actions, policies, or activities which undermine democracy in Venezuela,
  by enabling him to attack and control the democratically elected National Assembly.
  \ \n \nThere are lastly reasonable grounds to suspect that Duarte is a member of,
  or associated with, persons who have been involved with the repression of democratic
  opposition and other actions, policies, and activities which undermined democracy
  in Venezuela due to his involvement in Operation Alacran. \n"
