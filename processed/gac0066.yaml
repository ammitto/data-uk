uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Cinthia Edelmira
  Monterroso Gómez (“Monterroso”) is an involved person within the meaning of the
  Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations 2021 on the basis of the following
  grounds: \n \n(1) Monterroso is or has been involved in serious corruption, by being
  responsible for or engaging in serious corruption by way of receiving a bribe. As
  a prosecutor in the Public Ministry (Ministerio Público, MP), a foreign public official
  performing a judicial or executive function, Monterroso was promoted to Head of
  Unit at the Special Prosecution Office Against Impunity (Fiscalía Especial contra
  la Impunidad, FECI). She received this advantage to induce her to perform a public
  function improperly, namely by intentionally undermining corruption investigations
  into the political elite that nominated her. \n \n(2) Monterroso is or has been
  involved in serious corruption, by being responsible for the investigation or prosecution
  of serious corruption and intentionally failing to fulfil that responsibility. As
  a prosecutor in the MP, a foreign public official performing a judicial or executive
  function, Monterroso was promoted to Head of Unit at the FECI. She received this
  advantage to induce her to perform a public function improperly, namely by intentionally
  undermining corruption investigations into the political elite that nominated her.
  \n \n(3) Monterroso is or has been involved in serious corruption by using threats
  and intimidation to interfere in a law enforcement or judicial process in connection
  with serious corruption. As a prosecutor in the MP, a foreign public official performing
  a judicial or executive function, Monterroso was promoted to Head of Unit at the
  FECI. She received this advantage to induce her to perform a public function improperly,
  namely by intentionally launching baseless legal challenges against noted journalists
  and judicial figures who had uncovered corruption in order to silence them.\n"
