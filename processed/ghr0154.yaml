uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nKarlo Katsitadze is an involved person within the meaning
  of the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following
  ground: Karlo Katsitadze is and/or has been responsible for the investigation or
  prosecution of activity which amounts to a serious violation of the right of individuals
  not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and
  has intentionally or recklessly failed to fulfil that responsibility. \n \nSpecifically,
  during the protests that occurred after the passage of the foreign influence law,
  security forces from the Ministry of Internal Affairs Special Task Department (Special
  Task Department), and Tbilisi Police Department, violently targeted Georgian citizens,
  political opposition leaders, journalists, and youth activists. In his role as Head
  of the Special Investigatory Service, Karlo Katsitadze is responsible for investigating
  and holding law enforcement officials accountable for police violence, and in this
  instance has failed to do so. \n"
