  human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law in Myanmar
  for decades.\nAs Managing Director of Myanmar Chemical and Machinery Co Ltd , Aung
  Hlaing Oo has used his commercial and personal position to provide support for these
  activities in his role as an importer and broker of arms. Through his control of
  MCM, he has acted as a key source of weapons and commercial support for the junta,
  including through his close political/commercial ties with Eastern Europe. Aung
  Hlaing Oo, has therefore, been involved in the supply of restricted goods and/or
  technology, which could have contributed to serious human rights violations.\nAung
  Hlaing Oo, is also associated with the Commander in Chief, Min Aung Hlaing.\n  \n"
