  Aleksandr Petrash is the Chairman of the Moskovski District Court in Minsk. In his position, he bears responsibility for numerous politically motivated rulings against those taking part in protests. There are reasonable grounds to suspect this behaviour has continued following the 9 August Presidential elections in Belarus. He therefore bears responsibility for undermining the rule of law and through his actions as a judge, he has contributed to the repression of civil society and democratic opposition.
