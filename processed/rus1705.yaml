  for Entrepreneurs’ Rights and a prominent business person. TITOV is an involved
  person under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“Russia Regulations”)

  and 2) he is head of a public body, federal agency or service subordinate to the
  President of the Russian Federation, and thus meets regulation 6(4A)(b) of the Russia
  Regulations. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
