  The Htoo Group of Companies is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by U Tay Za, who is an involved person. Htoo Group of Companies contributed funds to the Tatmadaw in 2017, at a fundraising event for the Rakhine clearance operations held by Commander in Chief, Min Aung Hlaing. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that these funds contributed to serious human rights violations and ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Further and/or additionally, Myanmar Avia Export Ltd, a subsidiary of Htoo Group of Companies has connections to the Myanmar military, and has been responsible for brokering aircraft deals and arms with Russia, which, could have been used in serious human rights violations, including killings, arbitrary detention and torture in the Rakhine state and during the 2021 military coup.
