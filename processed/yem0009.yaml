other_information: With reference to the UN Panel of Experts’ Statement of Case of
  28 August 2019, Saleh Mesfer Saleh Al Shaer has engaged in acts that threaten the
  peace, security, and stability of Yemen thereby meeting the criteria for designation
  as laid out in Paragraph 17 of Resolution 2140 (2014). Serving as the Houthis’ Assistant
  Minister of Defence for Logistics, Saleh Mesfer Saleh Al Shaer assisted the Houthis
  in acquiring smuggled arms and weapons. He is also listed in connection with his
  direct involvement since early 2018 in the widespread and unlawful appropriation
  of assets and entities owned by private individuals under arrest by the Houthis
  or forced to take refuge outside of Yemen, in his capacity as ‘Judicial Custodian’
  and in violation of international humanitarian law. Al Shaer has used his authority
  and a Sana'a based network comprising members of his family, a special criminal
  court, the national security bureau, the central bank, the registrar services of
  the Yemeni Ministry of Trade and Industry, and some private banks in order to arbitrarily
  dispossess selected private individuals and entities of their wealth without any
  due judicial process or a possibility of redress.
