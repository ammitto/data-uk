uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs Former Commander of the anti-riot body Légion Nationale
  d'Intervention (LENI) of the Congolese National Police (PNC), Ferdinand Ilunga LUYOYO
  was responsible for disproportionate use of force and violent repression in September
  2016 in Kinshasa. In this capacity, Ferdinand Ilunga LUYOYO was therefore involved
  in planning, directing, or committing acts that constitute serious human rights
  violations and abuses in DRC. There are reasonable grounds to conclude that LUYOYO
  was an “involved person” given that matters within reg (6)(2) occurred in Kinshasa
  while he was in the role outlined above and therefore bore responsibility for the
  human rights violations committed by the PNC and LENI. \n"
