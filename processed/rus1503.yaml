uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAleyona Anatolyevna CHUGULEVA is a key individual associated
  with the disinformation website SouthFront, and has gathered donations to maintain
  their operations. SouthFront is a website which has spread disinformation relating
  to Ukraine and promoted the Government of Russia’s false narrative about the Russian
  invasion of Ukraine. CHUGULEVA is therefore a member of or associated with an entity
  which is or has been involved in supporting and promoting policies and actions which
  destabilise Ukraine and undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty
  and independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
