uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Crimea Railway (Federal State United Enterprise) continues
  to participate in the project of connecting the railway infrastructures of the illegally
  annexed Crimea and Russia by being owner and operator of the railway tracks and
  locomotives on the bridge over the Kerch Strait connecting Russia and the illegally
  annexed Crimean peninsula. Therefore, it supports the consolidation of the illegally
  annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation which in turn further undermines
  the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
