uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nGiorgi Gabitashvili is an involved person within the meaning
  of the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 on the basis of the following
  ground: Giorgi Gabitashvili is and/or has been responsible for the investigation
  or prosecution of  activity which amounts to a serious violation of the right of
  individuals not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
  and intentionally or recklessly fails to fulfil that responsibility. \n \nSpecifically,
  during the protests that occurred after the passage of the foreign influence law,
  security forces from the Ministry of Internal Affairs Special Task Department (Special
  Task Department), and Tbilisi Police Department, violently targeted Georgian citizens,
  political opposition leaders, journalists, and youth activists. In his role as General
  Prosecutor, Giorgi Gabitashvili is responsible for overseeing the investigation
  into, and prosecution of, law enforcement officials accountable for police violence
  and in this instance has failed to do so. \n"
