  “Khaled is assessed to have left the UK and travelled to Syria to engage in Islamist extremist activists on behalf of ISIL. It is assessed that Khaled has been involved in terrorist activity, and would likely seek to provide financial support to ISIL were his designation to lapse. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Khaled is an involved person as defined by the Counter-Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, and the Treasury considers that the designation remains appropriate.”
