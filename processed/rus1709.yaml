   JSC PLANT UNIVERSALMASH is an involved person under the Russian (EU Exit) (Sanctions) regulations 2019. JSC PLANT UNIVERSALMASH is a Russian based manufacturing plant, their main activity is currently the manufacture of the tracked chassis of the S-300V4 anti-aircraft missile system used by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that JSC PLANT UNIVERSALMASH is an “involved person” per regulations 6(2)(a)(i)&(ii) by “destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine” and by “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia” by carrying on business in the strategically important defence sector.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
