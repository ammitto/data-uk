uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Main Economic Department of the Administrative Affairs
  Office of the President of the Republic of Belarus (GHU) is the largest operator
  on the non-residential real estate market in Belarus. GHU provides  revenue and
  logistical support for the Belarusian regime and therefore directly supports the
  regime’s repressive actions. GHU’s former Director, Viktor Sheiman was one of the
  longest standing members of Lukashenko’s inner circle, and took part in preparations
  of the fraudulent Presidential elections, being responsible for security of polling
  stations. GHU acts at the direction of Valery Ivanov, who has supported or promoted
  the undermining of democracy by the Lukashenka regime in his role as the Head of
  the President Property Management Directorate.   \n"
