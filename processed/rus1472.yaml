uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n There are reasonable grounds to suspect Tetiana KUZMICH
  of participation in the so-called ‘Salvation Committee for Peace and Order’ and
  therefore that she is, or has been involved in providing support for and promoting
  policies and actions which destabilise Ukraine and undermine or threaten the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
