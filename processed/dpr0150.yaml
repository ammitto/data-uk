other_information: The Korea Heungjin Trading Company is used by KOMID for trading
  purposes. We suspect it has been involved in supplying missile-related goods to
  Iran’s Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG). Heungjin has been associated with
  KOMID, and, more specifically, KOMID’s procurement office. Heungjin has been used
  to procure an advanced digital controller with applications in missile design. KOMID
  was designated by the Committee in April 2009 and is the DPRK’s primary arms dealer
  and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional
  weapons. The Security Council designated SHIG in resolution 1737 (2006) as an entity
  involved in Iran’s ballistic missile programme.
