uk_statement_of_reasons: |2

  The Secretary of State considers there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the FOUNDATION FOR THE SUPPORT AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF COMPATRIOTS LIVING ABROAD (hereafter PRAVFOND) is an “involved person” under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on the basis of the following grounds: 1) PRAVFOND is or has been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia by carrying on business as a Government of Russia-affiliated entity by being owned or controlled by the Government of Russia; and 2) PRAVFOND is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine by making available funds that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine through funding the media outlets Euromore and Golos.
