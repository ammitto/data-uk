  Al-Fakher Advanced Works Co. Ltd is an involved person under the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, through its involvement in action, policy or activity which threatens the peace, stability and security of Sudan because of its central role in funding one of the main parties to the conflict, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), in particular by conducting RSF’s gold export business. RSF leaders have generated millions of dollars through gold exports, which  they have used to purchase weapons, including crew-served weapons and rocket-propelled grenades.
