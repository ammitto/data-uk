  Bonyad Taavon Sepah created Ansar Bank to provide financial and credit services to IRGC personnel. Initially, Ansar Bank operated as a credit union and transitioned into a fully fledged bank in mid 2009, upon receiving a license from Iran's Central Bank. Ansar Bank, formerly known as Ansar al Mojahedin, provides financial services to the IRGC. IRGC members received their salaries through Ansar Bank. In addition, Ansar Bank provides special benefits to IRGC personnel, including reduced rates for home furnishings, free or reduced-cost healthcare.
