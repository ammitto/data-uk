  The Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed (Al Zeir Salem) is an involved person under the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 because he is or has been responsible for, engaging in, providing support for, or promoting the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sudan, such as the deliberate targeting of civilians in El Fasher.
