uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nCurrently, Minister of University Education and former
  President of the National Electoral Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral – CNE).
  As CNE President between April 2006-June 2020, her actions and policies have undermined
  democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, including by failing to ensure that
  the CNE remains an impartial and independent institution in accordance with the
  Venezuelan Constitution thereby facilitating the establishment of the Constituent
  Assembly and the re-election of Nicolás Maduro in May 2018 through presidential
  elections that were neither free nor fair.  \n"
