uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nZeljka Cvijanovic, as President of Republika Srpska, is
  working with Milorad Dodik (also designated under the Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sanctions)
  (EU Exit) Regulations 2020) to undermine the territorial integrity,  international
  personality or constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through enacting
  the unilateral transfer of state competencies from the Government of Bosnia and
  Herzegovina to Republika Srpska, signing into law the legislative steps to begin
  to degrade/destroy state institutions as well as establishing an independent tax
  authority, medical agency, and army in the Republika Srpska. Cvijanovic’s actions
  are unconstitutional and go against the central tenets of the Dayton Peace Agreement
  as well as undermine the state’s competences in security. \n"
