  Lumberto Ignacio Campbell Hooker is a senior official in the Government of Nicaragua. He was the former Vice President and subsequently interim President of the Supreme Electoral Council of Nicaragua, and remains a magistrate of that organisation. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that in these roles he has stifled free and fair elections during civic protests in 2018, shown partisanship towards the Ortega Regime whilst serving as a senior official in the Supreme Electoral Council, and played an active role in disbanding opposition parties. He is responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, repression of civil society and the democratic opposition and for human rights violations.
