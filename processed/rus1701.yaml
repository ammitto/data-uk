uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAlexander REPIK is an involved person within the meaning
  of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 because he is the Chairman
  of the Board of R-Pharm, one of Russia’s largest pharmaceutical companies. R-Pharm
  receives financing from the Russian Direct Investment Fund, meaning it is a Government
  of Russia-affiliated entity. Therefore, REPIK is the director or equivalent of an
  entity that is both carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance to
  the Government of Russia, namely, the chemicals sector, and carrying on business
  as a Government of Russia-affiliated entity. REPIK is also associated to an involved
  person in destabilising Ukraine, namely, President Putin, through his close working
  relationship with Putin. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
