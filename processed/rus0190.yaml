uk_statement_of_reasons: |2-

  Mostotrest has actively participated in the construction of the Kerch Bridge through its State contract for the maintenance of the Bridge, connecting Russia to the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula. Furthermore, it is owned by an individual (Arkady Rotenberg) that is already designated for his actions undermining Ukrainian sovereignty. Therefore, the company is supporting the consolidation of the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
