uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAlvaro Enrique Pulido Vargas (aka German Enrique Rubio
  Salas) is a close business associate of Alex Saab. With him, he engaged in serious
  corruption in Venezuela through his participation in two of Venezuela’s public programmes:
  the ‘Local Committees for Supply and Production’ (CLAP) and the Great Housing Scheme
  Venezuela (GMVV). In each case, contracts were improperly granted for the benefit
  of an official and/or for another person including Pulido Vargas himself. In the
  CLAP programme, basic foodstuffs were provided at highly inflated prices. For GMVV,
  Global Construction Fund only delivered a small proportion of the products they
  had agreed to deliver, misappropriating the remainder of the funds. \n"
