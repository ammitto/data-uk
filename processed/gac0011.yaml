  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of $230m of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. MARKELOV participated in the fraud through his involvement, in particular, in the improper transfer of ownership of the company Parfenion and the submission of applications for fraudulent tax rebates. His actions facilitated or provided support for the serious corruption.
