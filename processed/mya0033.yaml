  The Directorate of Procurement sits within the Myanmar Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for the Myanmar Armed Forces who are perpetrating a campaign of violence and human rights violations across Myanmar. The Commander-in-Chief, a designated individual in his own right, is associated with the Directorate of Procurement in his capacity as head of the Tatmadaw. Evidence indicates the Directorate of Procurement plays a central role in procuring and maintain weapons and equipment for the Myanmar Armed Forces, allowing them to continue to repress peaceful protests in Myanmar.
