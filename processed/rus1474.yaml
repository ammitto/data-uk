uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Colonel Andrei Boevich KURBANOV is a Colonel in the 64th
  Motor Rifle Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. He is deemed
  to have been either in direct command of and/or in a position to hold considerable
  situational awareness of troops involved in the killing of civilians in the Kyiv
  suburb of Bucha in March 2022. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect
  that he is a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or
  promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens
  the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.  \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
