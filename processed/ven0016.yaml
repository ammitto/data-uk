  General Commander of the Bolivarian National Guard until 16 January 2018. Involved in the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Venezuela, and responsible for serious human rights violations committed by the Bolivarian National Guard under his command, including the excessive use of force, and the arbitrary detention and abuse of civil society and opposition members. His actions and policies as General Commander of the Bolivarian National Guard, including the Bolivarian National Guard assaulting members of the democratically elected National Assembly and intimidating journalists reporting on the fraudulent elections for the illegitimate Constituent Assembly, have undermined democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela.
