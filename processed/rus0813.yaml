uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Galina Alekseevna
  TOKAREVA is associated with Nikolai Petrovich TOKAREV. Galina Alekseevna TOKAREVA
  is the wife of Nikolai Petrovich TOKAREV (RUS0271) who has been designated by the
  UK since 10/03/2022. \nNikolai Petrovich TOKAREV is a prominent Russian businessman
  with significant interests in the extractives and energy industries, as well as
  a longstanding associate of Vladimir Putin. He is currently President of Transneft
  – a state enterprise that provides services for oil and oil products transportation
  within Russia and beyond. Transneft is a Government of Russia-affiliated entity
  which carries on business in sectors of strategic significance to the Government
  of Russia. TOKAREV is working as a director (whether executive or non-executive),
  trustee, or equivalent of Transneft, and is therefore a person who is or has been
  involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia.  \n
  The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
