uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n\tKonstantin ERNST (hereafter ERNST) is a media producer
  and chief executive officer of Channel One Russia (also known as the First Channel,
  Perviy Kanal and previously Public Russian Television / ORT). ERNST has been CEO
  of this organisation since 1999 and is responsible for all programming decisions.
  Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Channel One has significantly escalated
  its political broadcasts which have strong pro-invasion, pro-Kremlin messages. ERNST
  therefore engages in, provides support for, or promotes policies or actions which
  destabilise Ukraine or undermine or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty
  or independence of Ukraine.\n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
