  Oleg Silchenko was an investigator in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Interior Ministry and was directly involved in the mistreatment of Sergei Magnitsky whilst in detention, which contributed significantly to his death on 16 November 2009. Silchenko made six applications to extend Magnitsky’s detention period (despite his deteriorating medical condition), refused Magnitsky access to his family and engaged in the oppressive questioning and other mistreatment of Magnitsky to pressurise him to retract his allegations of corruption against Interior Ministry officials.
