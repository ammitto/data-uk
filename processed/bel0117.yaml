uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Main Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime and
  Corruption (GUBOPiK) of the MVD plays a leading role in the repression of civil
  society and democratic opposition in Belarus, including deploying specialised “Attack”
  units against peaceful protestors and in raids on the homes and offices of journalists,
  activists and opposition supporters.\nIn his position as Chairman of the GUBOPiK,
  Andrei PARSHYN is responsible for the inhuman and degrading treatment inflicted
  on citizens who participated in peaceful protests and for their arbitrary arrest
  and detention. Numerous testimonies, photo and video evidence indicate that the
  group under his command beat and arrested peaceful protestors, threatening them
  with firearms.\nPARSHYN therefore is or has been involved in undermining democracy
  and the rule of law in Belarus, repressing of civil society and the democratic opposition,
  and for serious human rights violations in Belarus.  \n"
