  Rafael Bastardo was Commander of FAES, the Special Action Force of the Venezuelan National Police between 2017 and 2019. There is reliable evidence that FAES committed serious human rights violations during Bastardo’s period in command. The recent UN Independent International Fact Finding Mission (IIFFM) report shows reasonable grounds to suspect that FAES was involved in multiple cases of extrajudicial executions. As FAES Commander, Bastardo is responsible for the human rights violations committed by FAES forces under his command.
