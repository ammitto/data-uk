  Head of Border Directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation for “Republic of Crimea and City of Sevastopol”, rear admiral. In this capacity, he was responsible for actions of the coast guard naval fleet of the Russian Federation against Ukraine on 25 November 2018 and thus actively contributed to the consolidation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
