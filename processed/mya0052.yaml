uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Myanmar Security Forces have a track record of committing
  serious human rights violations and repression of the civilian population of Myanmar.
  In 2017, the Myanmar Security Forces murdered, raped and tortured thousands of Rohingya
  during the Rakhine clearance operations. 740,000 Rohingya were forced over the border
  into Bangladesh.\nSky One Construction Company Limited contributed funds to the
  Myanmar Security Forces in 2017 at two fundraising events for the Rakhine clearance
  operations held by Commander in Chief, Min Aung Hlaing. Sky One Construction Company
  Limited has therefore made funds and economic resources available directly to or
  for the benefit of the Myanmar Security Forces, which could have contributed to
  serious human rights violations and repression of the civilian population in Myanmar.
