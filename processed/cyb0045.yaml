  Group 31 (APT31), is, or has been, involved in relevant cyber activity, including
  being responsible for, engaging in, or providing support for the commission, planning,

  on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) as part of the PRC’s state-sponsored
  apparatus and himself has engaged in relevant cyber activity, in support of malicious
  cyber activity that targeted officials, government entities and parliamentarians.
