uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nDmitry BEZRUKIKH is an involved person within the meaning
  of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 as BEZRUKIKH is: 1) the head
  of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service for the Rostov Region. The Rostov branch
  of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service is a public body of the Government of
  the Russian Federation. Therefore the head of a public body or agency of the Government
  of the Russian Federation; 2) through this role, BEZRUKIKH is also engaging in and
  providing support for policies and actions that destabilise Ukraine, namely through
  allowing Prigozhin, as head of the Wagner group, to recruit soldiers from prisons
  in Rostov ;and 3) Major General of the Internal Service in Russia and therefore
  a member of the armed forces or law-enforcement organs of the Russian Federation
  of the rank of colonel, or equivalent, or higher. Therefore, there is reasonable
  grounds to suspect that BEZRUKIKH is an involved person in destabilising Ukraine
  or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence
  of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
