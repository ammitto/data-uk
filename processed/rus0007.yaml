uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nMr Kovalchuk is a long-time acquaintance of President
  Putin and co-founder of the so-called Ozero Dacha, a cooperative society bringing
  together an influential group of individuals around President Putin. This includes
  close association to other involved persons. As the chairman and largest shareholder
  of Bank Rossiya, which is a key stakeholder in the National Media Group, Kovalchuk
  has actively supported actions which are undermining and threatening the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. This includes National Media
  Group support of Russian policy which is destabilising Ukraine; the formation of
  bank branches and provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol;
  and support to military activities and the formation of major transport links. Through
  these actions Kovalchuk is providing financial services and economic resources which
  are contributing to the destabilisation of Ukraine and undermining the territorial
  integrity of Ukraine, thereby consolidating the integration of Crimea into the Russian
  Federation.  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
