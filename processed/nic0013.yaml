uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs a senior commissioner of the Nicaraguan National Police
  (NNP), Juan Antonio Valle Valle is responsible for human rights violations against
  civilians during protests, which began on 18 April 2018. The NNP’s Department of
  Surveillance and Patrolling, of which Valle Valle is Chief, has repeatedly restricted
  the freedom of assembly and expression of Nicaraguans in Managua. Valle Valle was
  responsible for the harassment by police against individuals sheltered in the Metrocentro
  shopping centre in Managua in 2019. He is therefore responsible for undermining
  democracy and the rule of law, repression of civil society and the democratic opposition
  and for human rights violations. \n"
