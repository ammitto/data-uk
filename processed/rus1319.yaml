uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Saodat NARZIEVA is the sister of Alisher USMANOV, an involved
  person under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. USMANOV was designated
  by the UK on 3 March 2022. As an immediate family member of USMANOV Saodat NARZIEVA
  is associated with an involved person and therefore NARZIEVA is an involved person
  under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. \nThe trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023.\n"
