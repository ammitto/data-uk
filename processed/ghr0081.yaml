uk_statement_of_reasons: |2-

  Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) is a major Myanmar conglomerate, which in practice is owned and governed by, and for the benefit of, the Myanmar Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Tatmadaw who are responsible for serious human rights violations against the population of Myanmar, including the 2021 coup d'etat and violence against ethnic minorities, is under the command of the MoD. Also several former and serving member of the Tatmadaw are directors of MEC. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that MEC is associated with the Tatmadaw. Further or alternatively, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that MEC made funds available to the Tatmadaw by directly contributing to a fundraising event aimed at providing financial support for the Tatmadaw during the 2017 ‘clearance operations’ against the Rohingya. These “clearance operations” resulted in serious human rights violations, including mass unlawful killing, torture, systematic rape and targeted sexual violence.
