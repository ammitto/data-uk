  BELAERONAVIGATSIA Republican Unitary Air Navigation Services Enterprise is responsible for Belarusian air traffic control. It therefore bears responsibility for the order to intercept passenger flight FR4978 and compel its landing at Minsk airport, without proper justification, on 23 May 2021. In doing so, it acted on the direction of Alexander Lukashenko and in conjunction with the Belarusian defence forces. This resulted in the detention of the aircraft, its passengers and the crew, and the arrest of opposition journalist and civil society actor Roman Protasevich and Protasevich’s partner Sofia Sapega. This politically-motivated decision was aimed at arresting and detaining opposition journalist Protasevich and Sapega and constitutes a form of repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus.
