  Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) is a major Myanmar conglomerate, owned by the Myanmar military and its current and former personnel. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s Commander in Chief, is the Chair of MEHL’s ‘patron group’, along with other senior ranking Tatmadaw officers. In 2017, MEHL directly contributed to a series of fundraising events, which provided financial support for the Tatmadaw personnel engaged in “clearance operations” against the Rohingya. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that part or all of these funds contributed to operations that resulted in serious human rights violations, including mass unlawful killings, torture, systematic rape and other forms of targeted sexual violence by the Tatmadaw committed in Rakhine State in 2017. In view of the circumstances including the close connections between MEHL and senior members of the Tatmadaw, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that MEHL knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that the funds would or may contribute to the serious human rights violations committed. Further or alternatively, MEHL is associated with the Commander in Chief and Deputy Commander in Chief of the Tatmadaw in view of their connections to MEHL including their positions on the patron group.
