  Nikolai Karpenkov is the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and Commander of Internal Troops and former Head of the Main Directorate for Combating Organised Crime and Corruption. In both roles, he has engaged in and supported human rights violations and the repression of civil society in Belarus. In his current role, he is responsible for the actions of officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Internal Troops and therefore responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses against detained protestors and journalists, which have taken placed since Karpenkov assumed this role in November 2020.
