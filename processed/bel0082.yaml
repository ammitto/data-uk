  As Head of the Belarusian State Television and Radio Company, Ivan Eismont is responsible for the dissemination of state propaganda in public media. This includes using media channels to support the President’s continuation of his term in office, despite the fraudulent presidential elections that took place on 9 August 2020, and the subsequent and repeated violent crackdown on peaceful and legitimate protests. Eismont made public statements criticising the peaceful protesters and refused to provide media coverage of the protests.
