uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Sichuan Anxun Information Technology Co., Ltd. (i-Soon)
  has been involved in relevant cyber activity, including being responsible for, engaging
  in and providing support for malicious cyber activity that resulted in the exploitation
  of previously unknown vulnerabilities and gaining unauthorised access to over 80
  foreign government and private business networks.\n \nIn addition, i-Soon facilitated
  and supported a wider ecosystem of China-based information security companies, enabling
  actual or attempted unauthorised access to and interference with information systems
  and data, which targeted UK public sector and private industry IT systems through,
  namely, researching, exploiting and sharing of vulnerabilities. This malicious activity
  undermined or was intended to undermine the integrity, prosperity or security of
  the United Kingdom or a country other than the United Kingdom.\n"
