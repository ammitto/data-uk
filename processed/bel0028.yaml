  TSERABAU was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the State Security Committee (KGB) of Belarus in February 2020. In this senior leadership role, we believe he has shared responsibility for the activities of the State Security Committee, including the involvement of KGB officers, in serious human rights violations and abuse against detained protestors and journalists, which they carried out following the election of 9 August.
