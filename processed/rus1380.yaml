uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nSHKOLNIK is Director of the Central Museum of the Great
  Patriotic War and Chairman of the Presidium of the Foundation for Strategic Initiatives
  of the Victory Museum in Russia. He has used his position as the head of a significant
  national cultural institution to spread disinformation, including supporting and
  promoting the Government of Russia’s false narrative that the invasion of Ukraine
  is an exercise of “de-Nazification”. SHKOLNIK has therefore provided support for
  or promoted policies and actions which destabilise Ukraine and threaten the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
