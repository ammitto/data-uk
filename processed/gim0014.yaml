uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nMohammed TETWANI is an involved person under the Global
  Irregular Migration Sanctions Regulations 2025 on the basis of the following grounds:
  \ He has been responsible for or engaged in a relevant activity, namely people smuggling.
  With a view to obtaining, whether directly or indirectly, a gain or benefit, he
  was responsible for the unlawful arrival of persons into a country of a person who
  is not a national of that country or permanently resident in it. Namely, as leader
  of the TETWANI people smuggling gang, known as one of the most violent gangs, he
  controlled one of the makeshift migrant camps near Horgos in Serbia, close to the
  border with Hungary, and charged fees per person to organise illegal crossings.
  \ He referred to himself as the \"King of Horgos”,and issued fake passports with
  his seal on the paper. He also facilitated smuggling of Tunisian migrants to France.
