uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n JOINT STOCK COMPANY MIKRON is an involved person under
  the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulation 2019 because it is the largest Russian
  manufacturer and exporter of microelectronics. The company received tax benefits
  to produce the domestic chip for Russia’s National Payment Card System, which was
  developed following previous sanctions on Russia. Therefore, JOINT STOCK COMPANY
  MIKRON is involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia
  by carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance to the Government
  of Russia, namely the Russian electronics sector. \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
