uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nColonel General Andrey SERDYUKOV is the Commander of the
  Airborne Forces of the Russian Federation. The Russian Airborne Forces have been
  heavily involved in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia, including an aerial
  assault on the city of Kharkiv. As the Airborne Supreme Commander, Colonel General
  SERDYUKOV has oversight of and directs the actions of the Russian Airborne Forces.
  \nThere are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that SERDYUKOV is an involved
  person, who is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes any
  policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
