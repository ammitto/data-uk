uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n JSC Kalashnikov Concern is a Russian weapons manufacturer
  which has supplied products used by the Russian army in Ukraine. JSC Kalashnikov
  Concern has therefore provided goods or technology to a person who is responsible
  for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes policies or actions which destabilise
  Ukraine or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence
  of Ukraine. In addition, a Russian state-owned defence conglomerate, Rostec State
  Corporation, also owns 25% plus one of the shares of JSC Kalashnikov Concern and
  so they are an involved person through carrying on business as a Government of Russia-affiliated
  entity.  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
