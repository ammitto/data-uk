uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Pavel Arkedyevich
  ROTENBERG is associated with and has obtained other material benefit from Arkady
  Romanovich ROTENBERG (RUS0123). Pavel Arkedyevich ROTENBERG is the son of Arkady
  Romanovich ROTENBERG (RUS0123) who has been designated by the UK since 31/12/2020.\nArkady
  Rotenberg is a prominent Russian businessman who has close personal ties to President
  Putin. Since March 2014, Rotenberg, or his companies, have received State contracts
  totalling over USD 7 Billion. In 2015, Rotenberg led the annual list of government
  contracts in terms of value, after being awarded contracts worth 555 Billion roubles
  from the Russian Government. Many of these contracts were awarded without formal
  competitive processes. On 30 January 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed
  a decree that awarded to Stroygazmontazh (Rotenberg’s company at the time), a State
  contract for the construction of the Kerch Bridge from Russia to the illegally annexed
  Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Through these contracts he has financially benefited
  from Russian Decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea or the destabilisation
  of eastern Ukraine. He was the owner of the company Stroygazmontazh until 2019,
  which has been awarded a State contract for the construction of the Kerch bridge
  from Russia to the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea, therefore consolidating
  its integration into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the
  territorial integrity of Ukraine. Similarly, in January 2017, Stroygazmontazh was
  awarded the State contract worth 17 billion roubles for the construction of a railway
  line on the Kerch bridge, which again further undermines the territorial integrity
  of Ukraine. Other activities included being the the chairman of the board of directors
  of the publishing house Prosvescheniye until 2017, which has notably implemented
  the project ‘To the Children of Russia: Address- Crimea’, a public relations campaign
  that was designed to persuade Crimean children that they are now Russian citizens
  living in Russia, and thereby supporting the Russian Government's policy to integrate
  Crimea into Russia. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
