uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Vice-Admiral Vladimir KASATONOV is the Deputy Commander-in-Chief
  of the Navy of the Russian Federation. It is known that elements of the Russian
  Navy have been heavily involved in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia, including
  conducting missile strikes on cities and launching amphibious assaults. As Deputy
  Commander-in-Chief, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Vice-Admiral KASATONOV
  will have directed operations against Ukraine by the Russian Navy and/or otherwise
  have had responsibility for, involvement in and influence over such operations.
  He has also been utilised as a special envoy to garner support for the Russian invasion
  of Ukraine. He is therefore a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides
  support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines
  or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
