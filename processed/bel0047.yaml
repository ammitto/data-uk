uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nViktor Lukashenko is the former National Security Adviser
  to the President of Belarus and a former member of the Security Council of Belarus.
  In these roles, he oversaw law enforcement and the security services and was therefore
  responsible for the serious human rights violations perpetrated against protestors
  and journalists following the Presidential election on 9 August 2020.  \nSince February
  2021, Viktor Lukashenko has been the President of the National Olympic Committee
  of the Republic of Belarus (NOC). Prior to this, he was the First Vice President
  of the NOC. The International Olympic Committee has adopted measures against the
  NOC for not appropriately protecting athletes from reprisals against them for protesting
  the 9 August 2020 elections and subsequent violent suppression of peaceful protests.
  Viktor Lukashenko is therefore responsible for supporting the Lukashenko regime
  in its repression of civil society or democratic opposition or other actions, policies
  or activities which undermine democracy or the rule of law in Belarus. \n"
