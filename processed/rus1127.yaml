  Viacheslav KANTOR, hereafter KANTOR, is a prominent Russian businessman associated with Vladimir Putin. KANTOR is the Chairman of the Coordinating Board of PJSC ‘Acron’ and its largest shareholder. Acron is a Russian chemical, mineral and fertilizer producer which carries on business in a sector of strategic significance to the Government of Russia, namely the Russian chemicals and extractives sectors. KANTOR therefore owns or controls directly or indirectly and/or works as a director (whether executive or non-executive) trustee, or equivalent of a person other than an individual carrying on business of economic significance to the Government of Russian in sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russian. Hence KANTOR is involved in gaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia, whose actions are destabilising Ukraine or undermining or destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
