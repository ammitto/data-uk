   The Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Eskandar MOMENI is an involved person under The Iran (Sanctions) Regulations 2023 on the basis of the following ground: MOMENI is or has been responsible for a serious human rights violation or abuse in Iran, in his role as Iran’s Interior Minister and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces in the police force, based on the violence perpetrated against protestors in 2025 and 2026 by Iranian security forces.
