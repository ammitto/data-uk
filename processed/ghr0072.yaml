uk_statement_of_reasons: |2-

  Viktor Pshonka was Prosecutor-General of Ukraine during the suppression of the Ukrainian protest movement from 2013-2014. His office was the primary organ for investigating allegations against Ukrainian law enforcement. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that he intentionally or recklessly failed to ensure that his office investigated credible allegations of torture and the illegal use of lethal force by Ukrainian law enforcement, or properly investigated cases of the torture and killings of protesters.
