  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Basij Resistance Force is an involved person under the Iran (Sanctions) Regulations 2023 as it has been involved in serious human rights violations in Iran, including being responsible for, engaging in and providing support for violations of the right to life and right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly through the violent repression of protests in Iran.
