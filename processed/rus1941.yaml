  Judge Vitaly BELITSKY is an involved person under the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019.  BELITSKY was one of three judges who presided over the politically motivated trial of Vladimir Kara-Murza on charges including disseminating false information about the Russian Army under part 2 of article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws. The prosecution  of Kara-Murza is widely considered to be politically motivated. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.  This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. BELITSKY’s role as a judge in the trial of Kara-Murza shows that he is providing support for this policy. Therefore, BELITSKY is an involved person because he is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
