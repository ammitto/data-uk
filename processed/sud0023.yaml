  The Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris is an involved person under the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 because he is or has been responsible for the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law in Sudan, such as violence against persons on the basis of their ethnicity or religious beliefs and the deliberate targeting of civilians.
