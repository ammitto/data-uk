  Hassan ASGARI is an involved person within the meaning of the Iran (Sanctions) Regulations 2023 as it is reasonable to suspect that ASGARI, through his role as Governor of Sanandaj, is an individual providing support for or promoting serious human rights violations in Iran through the repression of recent protests in Iran, leading to violations of the right of life and violations of the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
