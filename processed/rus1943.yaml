uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nJudge Natalia DUDAR is an involved person under the Russia
  (EU Exit) (Sanctions) regulations 2019.  DUDAR was a judge who extended the period
  of detention of Vladimir Kara-Murza as he awaited trial for three charges, of which
  he was ultimately found guilty, which included that of disseminating false information
  about the Russian Armed Forces under part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal
  Code, also known as the “fake news” law. The prosecution of Kara-Murza is widely
  considered to be politically motivated. This law and its application and enforcement
  by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent
  the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.  This policy
  prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, anti-war
  sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for and undermine the Russian
  Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the
  continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial
  integrity and sovereignty. DUDAR’s decision to extend the period of detention of
  Kara-Murza under the “fake news” charge shows that she is providing support for
  this policy. Therefore, DUDAR is an involved person because she is providing support
  for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity
  and sovereignty. \n"
