uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nLLC Synesis (“Synesis”), including through its former
  wholly-owned subsidiary, LLC 24x7 Panoptes (“Panoptes”), has supplied the Kipod
  Technology (“Kipod”) to the Republic of Belarus for use with the “Republican System
  for Monitoring Public Safety” (“RSMPS”), which is a video surveillance and monitoring
  system. The RSMPS is used by the Belarus Ministry of Internal Affairs, as the State
  body authorised to coordinate the use of the RSMPS, and law enforcement agencies,
  including by security and police units. Kipod is a key part of the RSMPS.  \nThe
  RSMPS, relying on Kipod, has provided the Ministry of Internal Affairs and law enforcement
  agencies with the capability inter alia, to track down civil society and pro-democracy
  activists, in order to repress them. Further, that capability has been so used.
  For example, following the elections on 9 August 2020, Nikolay Dedok, a civil society
  activist who was in hiding was tracked down by the RSMPS using the Kipod system.
  He was subsequently detained and tortured.  \nSynesis has therefore been involved
  in the commission of a serious human rights violation or abuse in Belarus and/or
  the repression of civil society or democratic opposition in Belarus as Synesis has
  been responsible for and/or has provided support for, either or both such activities;
  and/or that Synesis has been involved in the supply to Belarus of technology which
  could contribute to either or both such activities. \n"
