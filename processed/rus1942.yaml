uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nJudge Ekaterina DOROKHINA is an involved person under
  the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019.  DOROKHINA \nwas one of three
  judges, who presided over the politically motivated trial of Vladimir Kara-Murza
  on charges including disseminating false information about the Russian Army under
  part 2 of article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake\n
  news” laws. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts
  is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from
  knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.  This policy prevents the spread
  of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, anti-war sentiment and dissent,
  which would reduce public support for and undermine the Russian Government’s ability
  to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the
  war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and
  sovereignty. DOROKHINA’s role as a judge in the trial of Kara-Murza shows that she
  is providing support for this policy. Therefore, DOROKHINA is an involved person
  because she is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and
  undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n"
