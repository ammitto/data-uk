uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nXavier Antonio Moreno Reyes previously (until 12 June
  2020) served as Secretary General of the National Electoral Council (CNE). There
  are reasonable grounds to suspect he that Xavier Antonio Moreno Reyes (1) has been
  involved in undermining democracy and repressing the democratic opposition in Venezuela
  by signing, facilitating, legitimising and giving credibility to signing off CNE
  decisions, (including those which facilitated the establishment of the National
  Constituent Assembly and manipulation of the electoral process), and (2) has acted
  on behalf of, and/or at the direction of, and/or in association with, the former
  President of the CNE, Tibisay Lucena Ramirez. \n"
