uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAs Commander of the 1st Defence Zone of Congolese Army
  (FARDC) Gabriel KUMBA was officially responsible for FARDC forces who took part
  in the disproportionate use of force and violent repression in September 2016 in
  Kinshasa. In this capacity, Gabriel KUMBA was therefore involved in planning, directing,
  or committing acts that constitute serious human rights violations and abuses in
  DRC.  There are reasonable grounds to conclude that KUMBA was an “involved person”
  given that matters within reg (6)(2) occurred within the territory  (First Defence
  Zone) for which he was the FARDC Commander and thus bore responsibility for. \n"
