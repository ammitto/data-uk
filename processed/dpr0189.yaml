other_information: The Second Academy of Natural Sciences is a national-level organization
  responsible for research and development of the DPRK’s advanced weapons systems,
  including missiles and probably nuclear weapons. The Second Academy of Natural Sciences
  uses a number of subordinate organizations to obtain technology, equipment, and
  information from overseas, including Tangun Trading Corporation, for use in the
  DPRK’s missile and probably nuclear weapons programs. Tangun Trading Corporation
  was designated by the Committee in July 2009 and is primarily responsible for the
  procurement of commodities and technologies to support DPRK’s defense research and
  development programs, including, but not limited to, weapons of mass destruction
  and delivery system programs and procurement, including materials that are controlled
  or prohibited under relevant multilateral control regimes.
