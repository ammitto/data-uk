uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nFormer deputy general director for infrastructure projects
  at Stroygazmontazh (SGM) who since 2015 had supervised the construction of the bridge
  over the Kerch Strait (including the railway part of the bridge) connecting Russia
  and the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula.  Therefore, he supported the consolidation
  of the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in
  turn further undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence
  of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
