uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nChief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief FANB, Deputy
  Minister of Monitoring and Inspection of Government Administration, and Secretary
  General of the National Defence Council (SECODENA). \nJosé Adelino Ornelas Ferreira
  has been Second in Command and Chief of Staff of Strategic Command Operations of
  the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (CEOFANB) since June 2017, having been appointed
  to the post by Nicolas Maduro. The CEOFANB is the highest point of command in the
  Venezuelan armed forces. The CEOFANB sets the strategic direction of all strands
  of the Venezuelan military (Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Guard (GNB)), co-ordinates
  them, and implements operations. Since September 2020, Ornelas has been the Chief
  of the General Staff to the Commander in Chief.  \nThere is reliable evidence that
  the GNB has committed serious human rights violations during Ferreira’s period in
  charge. A report by OHCHR in 2018 documents incidents of people deprived of their
  liberty and subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and (in many cases
  possibly) torture, reportedly carried out in part by the GNB. Some of these incidents
  occurred in the period that Ferreira has held the position of Commander of the CEOFANB.
  As a commander of the CEOFANB, and Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief and
  Strategic Command Operations, and thus in charge of the GNB, there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those acts.  \nThere is reliable
  evidence that the GNB used excessive force against people in the Pemon territory
  in February 2019, including killing three people, and carried out extrajudicial
  killings of an alleged terrorist group in El Junquito, Caracas. As a CEOFANB Commander
  and Chief of Staff at the time, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira
  was involved in those grave human rights violations.  \nFinally, there is reliable
  evidence that In May 2019 members of the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB), which
  sits under the command of the CEOFANB, during Ferreira’s time in role, used tear
  gas to disperse a march of opposition supporters. Due to his role, Ferreira is partially
  responsible for this repression of civil society and violation of freedom of expression.
