    The Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) was responsible for a cyber attack on a petro-chemical company in August 2017. The cyber attack gained remote access to the Safety Instrumented Systems connected to the Industrial Control System of a petrochemical refinery.  This shut down the plant for over a week. There is evidence to suggest that the shutdown was inadvertent while TsNIIKhM were attempting to cause a highly dangerous physical consequence through disabling the safety systems, which could have included an explosion. These actions caused economic loss and prejudice to commercial interests and/or was intended to undermine the security and prosperity of a country other than the United Kingdom.
