  Keeper of Ward 1 of Radjaishahr prison, Karadj until July 2010. Several former detainees have denounced the use of torture by him, as well as orders he gave to prevent inmates receiving medical assistance. According to a transcript of one reported detainee in the Radjaishahr prison, wardens all beat him severely, with Akharian’s full knowledge. There is also at least one reported case of ill treatment and the death of a detainee, Mohsen Beikvand, under Akharian’s wardenship. Beikvand died in September 2010. Other prisoners claim credibly that he was killed by the instructions of Hassan Akharian.
