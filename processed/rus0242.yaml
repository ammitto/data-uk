   Public Joint Stock Company (PJSC) United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) is a Russian state-owned enterprise. USC is the largest shipbuilding corporation in Russia, uniting shipbuilding, repair and maintenance subsidiaries. This includes the supply of several frigates and other warship classes that have been deployed in Crimea since Russia illegally annexed the region in 2014, and have conducted drills in the Black Sea in 2021. Therefore USC has been involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. USC also operates in a sector of strategic significance, specifically, the Russian defence sector. As a result USC is involved in benefitting from or supporting the Government of Russia.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
