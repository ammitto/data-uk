  Mikhail SHELOMOV (henceforth SHELOMOV) is a Russian business owner and the first cousin, once removed, of President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. SHELOMOV, via his firm "Akcept" LLC, is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which is a key stakeholder in the National Media Group which supports Russian policy which is destabilising Ukraine. Following the annexation of Crimea, Bank Rossiya has expanded its bank branches and provision of insurance throughout Crimea and Sevastopol; and offers support to military activities and the formation of major transport links and cards that allow the public to travel easily around the peninsula. Therefore, Bank Rossiya has supported the consolidation of Crimea into the Russian Federation by integrating the financial system following the annexation of Crimea. SHELOMOV therefore is or has been involved in engaging in, providing support for, or promoting any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. SHELOMOV is also associated with Russian insurance firm SOGAZ, a UK-sanctioned entity which carries on business in the Russian financial services sector, which is a sector of strategic significance to the Government of Russia. SHELOMOV owns "Akcept" LLC, which operates in the Russian financial services sector, a sector of strategic significance to the Government of Russia. SHELOMOV is therefore involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia.
   The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
