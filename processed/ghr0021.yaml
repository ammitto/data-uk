  Sergei Podoprigorov was a judge at Moscow’s Tverskoi district court. He made two rulings in relation to Sergei Magnitsky: in November 2008 to approve Magnitsky’s arrest and in March 2009 to prolong his detention. In this capacity, Podoprigorov authorised Magnitsky’s detention, prolonging his detention without trial without subjecting to challenge the evidence originally provided to justify Magnitsky’s detention or exploring other factors relevant to the decision. Podoprigorov therefore facilitated the mistreatment and death of Magnitsky by authorising the extension of his detention.
