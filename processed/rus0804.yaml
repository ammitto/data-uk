uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Liliya Arkadyevna
  ROTENBERG is associated with and has obtained a financial benefit from Arkady Romanovich
  ROTENBERG (RUS0123) and Igor Arkadyevich ROTENBERG (RUS0247). Liliya Arkadyevna
  ROTENBERG is the daughter of Arkady Romanovich ROTENBERG (RUS0123) who has been
  designated by the UK since 31/12/2020 and the sister of Igor Arkadyevich ROTENBERG
  (RUS0247) who has been designated by the UK since 22/02/2022.\n Arkady Rotenberg
  is a prominent Russian businessman who has close personal ties to President Putin.
  Since March 2014, Rotenberg, or his companies, have received State contracts totalling
  over USD 7 Billion. In 2015, Rotenberg led the annual list of government contracts
  in terms of value, after being awarded contracts worth 555 Billion roubles from
  the Russian Government. Many of these contracts were awarded without formal competitive
  processes. On 30 January 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree that
  awarded to Stroygazmontazh (Rotenberg’s company at the time), a State contract for
  the construction of the Kerch Bridge from Russia to the illegally annexed Autonomous
  Republic of Crimea. Through these contracts he has financially benefited from Russian
  Decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea or the destabilisation
  of eastern Ukraine. He was the owner of the company Stroygazmontazh until 2019,
  which has been awarded a State contract for the construction of the Kerch bridge
  from Russia to the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea, therefore consolidating
  its integration into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the
  territorial integrity of Ukraine. Similarly, in January 2017, Stroygazmontazh was
  awarded the State contract worth 17 billion roubles for the construction of a railway
  line on the Kerch bridge, which again further undermines the territorial integrity
  of Ukraine. Other activities included being the the chairman of the board of directors
  of the publishing house Prosvescheniye until 2017, which has notably implemented
  the project ‘To the Children of Russia: Address- Crimea’, a public relations campaign
  that was designed to persuade Crimean children that they are now Russian citizens
  living in Russia, and thereby supporting the Russian Government's policy to integrate
  Crimea into Russia.\nIgor Arkadyevich ROTENBERG is a prominent Russian businessman
  with close familial ties to President Putin. Igor Arkadyevich ROTENBERG is the Chairman
  of the Board of Directors of National Telematic Systems (NTS). NTS is conducting
  business in the transport sector, which is of strategic significance to the Government
  of Russia, and therefore through his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors
  to NTS, Igor Arkadyevich ROTENBERG is benefiting from or supporting the Government
  of Russia. Igor Arkadyevich ROTENBERG is also a shareholder in RT-Invest Transport
  Systems (RTITS). RTITS, through the \"Platon\" toll system, is conducting business
  in the transport sector, which is of strategic significance to the Government of
  Russia. It is also obtaining a benefit from the Government of Russia.   \n The trust
  services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
