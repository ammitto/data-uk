  In December 2007, an organised criminal group was involved in serious corruption through the misappropriation of the equivalent of $230m of Russian state property via a complex scheme involving a fraudulent tax rebate. SHESHENYA participated in the fraud through his involvement, in particular, in court processes based on fraudulent claims for damages, as the director of Grand-Aktiv LLC. His actions facilitated or provided support for the serious corruption.
