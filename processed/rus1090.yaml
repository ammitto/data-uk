uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe WAGNER GROUP is often described as a Russia-based
  Private Military Company and is an entity or group that provides military services
  for financial gain. It has organised the recruitment of, and coordinated and planned
  operations for, the Wagner Group mercenaries participating in military operations
  in Ukraine. There are multiple, credible sources which corroborate and support the
  conclusion that the existence of the organisation known as the Wagner Group is kept
  purposefully vague and opaque in order to provide a deniable military capability
  for the Russian State.  \n \nThe WAGNER GROUP is therefore responsible for, engages
  in, and provides support for actions which destabilise Ukraine and undermine or
  threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The
  trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
