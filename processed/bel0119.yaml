  As a journalist reporting on the state-owned TV channel CTV, Grigoriy Yurievich AZARENOK, hereafter AZARENOK has willingly provided the Belarusian public with false information about the democratic opposition and protests, thus lending support to the regime. AZARENOK has vocally supported and attempted to justify the repression of the democratic opposition and of civil society who seek to demonstrate evidence of serious human rights violations committed by the regime. His journalism is specifically endorsed by the Lukashenko regime as it is the subject of several state sponsored awards.
  AZARENOK therefore is or has been involved in undermining democracy and the rule of law in Belarus, and repressing civil society and the democratic opposition.
