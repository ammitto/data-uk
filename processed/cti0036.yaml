  "The PKK is a Kurdish terrorist organisation, proscribed by the UK, the EU and NATO, which was formed in the late 1970s and has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks, mainly against Turkish state security forces but also civilians. Its attacks are mainly carried out in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast. Cooperation exists between the PKK in Turkey and other Kurdish armed groups in the region situated along the Öcalan axis of support. These like-minded groups identify as being under the cross-border umbrella of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK).
