uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nOJSC BELARUSKALI is one of the world’s largest producers
  of the key fertilizer ingredient potassium chloride (potash), and is 100% owned
  by the Belarusian state. As a state-owned enterprise, OJSC BELARUSKALI is a major
  source of revenue and foreign currency for the Lukashenko regime, including through
  the transfer of OJSC BELARUSKALI’s profits to the National Development Fund which
  is directed by Lukashenko. Export duties and taxes generated by OJSC BELARUSKALI
  account for 8-10% of the total budget of the Government of Belarus, and are therefore
  critically important in maintaining the regime and enabling its actions. Through
  the production of potash and its treatment of striking workers during the protests
  and crackdown in 2020, OJSC BELARUSKALI has helped prop up the authoritarian rule
  of Lukashenko’s regime. OJSC BELARUSKALI therefore is or has been involved in providing
  support for the Government of Belarus, which has taken actions to undermine democracy
  and the rule of law, repress civil society and the democratic opposition, and commit
  serious human rights violations. \n"
