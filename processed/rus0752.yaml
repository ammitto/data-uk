uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Sergei Pavlovich
  ROLDUGIN is associated with and has obtained other material benefit from President
  Vladimir Putin (RUS0251) and the Russian state. Sergei Pavlovich ROLDUGIN is a close
  friend and associate of Vladimir Putin (RUS0251) who has been designated by the
  UK since 25 February 2022. Vladimir Vladimirovich PUTIN (RUS0251) is the President
  of the Russian Federation, carrying ultimate authority for the policy of the Russian
  government and Russian armed forces. In February 2022, Putin ordered Russian military
  forces to launch an invasion of Ukraine, undermining and threatening the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.  \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
