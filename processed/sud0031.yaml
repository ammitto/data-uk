uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect that Mustafa Ibrahim Abdel Nabi Mohamed is an involved person
  under the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (1) through his association
  with Alkhaleej Bank Co Ltd; and (2) Mustafa Ibrahim Abdel Nabi Mohamed himself is
  or has been  providing financial services that could contribute to an action, policy
  or activity which threatens the peace, stability and security of Sudan because he
  has acted as financial advisor to the RSF and he has therefore contributed to the
  RSF’s siege of El Fasher in North Darfur and the RSF’s operations elsewhere in Sudan.\n
