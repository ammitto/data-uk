uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nIn her former position as assistant prosecutor at the
  Fruzensky District Court in Minsk, Alina Sergeevna KASYANCHYK has represented the
  Lukashenko regime in politically motivated cases against journalists, activists
  and protesters.\nIn particular, she has prosecuted BelSat journalists Katsiaryna
  Bakhvalava (Andreyeva) and Darya Chultsova for live streaming peaceful protests,
  based on the unwarrented charges of “conspiracy” and “violating public order”. She
  has also prosecuted members of Belarusian civil society e.g. for taking parts in
  peaceful protests, and paying tribute to murdered protester Aliaksandr Taraikousky.
  She has consistently asked the judge for disproportionately long-term prison sentences.\nKASYANCHYK
  therefore is or has been involved in undermining democracy and the rule of law in
  Belarus, repressing civil society and the democratic opposition in Belarus, and
  for serious human rights violations.   \n"
