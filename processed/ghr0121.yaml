uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nLieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Valerievich OBRAZTSOV (“OBRAZTSOV”)
  is and/or has been responsible for activities that amount to serious violations
  of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
  and the right to life. Namely, OBRAZTSOV as Deputy Head of the Arctic Penal Colony
  IK-3, is responsible for the mistreatment of prisoners through the operations and
  conditions at Arctic Penal Colony IK-3. This mistreatment likely contributed to
  the death of Alexei Navalny, including the failure to ensure the provision of adequate
  medical treatment and/or the failure to provide, timely access for emergency services
  to provide treatment. \n"
