uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nRuslan Aleksandrovich PERETYATKO, a Russian FSB Intelligence
  Officer and a member of the Callisto Group (AKA Seaborgium, Star Blizzard, Cold
  River), is or has been involved in relevant cyber activity, including being responsible
  for, engaging in, providing support for, or promoting the commission, planning or
  preparation of relevant cyber activity. This included the preparation of spear-phishing
  campaigns and associated activity that resulted in unauthorised access and exfiltration
  of sensitive data. This action undermined, or was intended to undermine, the integrity,
  prosperity and security of UK organisations and more broadly, the UK government,
  and directly or indirectly caused, or was intended to cause, economic loss to, or
  prejudice to the commercial interests of, those affected by the activity.  \n  \nThe
  Callisto Group, a cyber programme operated by officers of the Russian FSB\n,\n was
  responsible for intrusions into the Institute for Statecraft (IfS), a UK-based think
  tank responsible for a programme to research, publicise, and counter the threat
  to European democracies from disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare. Official
  documents belonging to IfS were released in the hack and subsequent leak, resulting
  from the preparation of spear-phishing campaigns and associated activity.  \n"
