  In his position as Minister for Transport and Communication of the Republic of Belarus, Aliaksei Auramenka is responsible for the state management of civil aviation and supervision of air traffic control. He is therefore responsible for the forced redirection and landing of Ryanair passenger flight FR4978 at Minsk airport, without proper justification, on 23 May 2021. In so doing, Auramenka acted at the direction of Alexander Lukashenko and in conjunction with the Belarusian Ministry of Defence. These politically motivated decisions were aimed at detaining and arresting the opposition journalist and civil society actor Roman Protasevich and Protasevich’s partner Sofia Sapega and are a form of repression against civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus. Therefore, Aliaksei Auramenka is responsible for the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus and so undermined democracy and the rule of law there.
