other_information: As Chief of General Staff of the SPLA, Malong expanded or extended
  the conflict in South Sudan through breaches of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement
  and breaches of the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan
  (ARCSS). He reportedly directed efforts to kill opposition leader Riek Machar. He
  ordered SPLA units to prevent the transport of humanitarian supplies. Under Malong’s
  leadership, the SPLA attacked civilians, schools and hospitals; forced the displacement
  of civilians; carried out enforced disappearances; arbitrarily detained civilians;
  and conducted acts of torture, and rape. He mobilized the Mathiang Anyoor Dinka
  tribal militia, which uses child soldiers. Under his leadership, the SPLA restricted
  UNMISS, the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), and CTSAMM access
  to sites to investigate and document abuses.
