  In his position as Chairman of the Second National Television Station (ONT), Marat Markov is responsible for the programming and editorial decisions of the station, including the decision to record and broadcast an ‘interview’ with the detained opposition activist and civil society actor Roman Protasevich, widely believed to be filmed under duress and with Protasevich showing signs of ill treatment. This action is directly linked to the politically motivated decision to divert Ryanair flight FR4978 to Minsk airport on 23 May 2021 without proper justification, aimed at arresting and detaining opposition journalist and civil society actor Protasevich and Protasevich’s partner, Sofia Sapega and is a form of repression against civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus. Marat Markov is therefore responsible for the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus and so undermined democracy and the rule of law there.
