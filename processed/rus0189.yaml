  Public ‘organisation’ that presented candidates in the so called ‘elections’ of the so called ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’ 2 November 2014. These elections are in breach of Ukrainian law and therefore illegal. In participating formally in the illegal ‘elections’ it has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and to further destabilise Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
