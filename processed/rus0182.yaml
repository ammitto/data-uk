  The so called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ was established on 27 April 2014. Responsible for organising the illegal referendum on May 11 2014, and made a declaration of independence on May 12 2014. On 22 May 2014, the so called ‘People's Republics’ of Donetsk and Lugansk created the so called ‘Federal State of Novorossiya’. The so called “Lugansk People’s Republic” took part in ‘elections’ on 11 November 2018. Holding any kind of elections without Ukraine’s consent is a clear violation of the country’s sovereignty. This is in breach of Ukrainian constitutional law, and, as a consequence, of international law, thus undermining the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. It is also involved in the recruitment to the separatist ‘Army of Southeast’ and other illegal armed separatist groups, thus undermining the stability or security of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
