  Joint Stock company The Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s Construction Directorate participated in the project of connecting the railway infrastructures of the illegally annexed Crimea and Russia by providing engineering services during the construction of railway approaches to the bridge over the Kerch Strait connecting Russia and the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula. Therefore, it supports the consolidation of the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
