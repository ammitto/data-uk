uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Secretary of State considers that there are reasonable
  grounds to suspect Nusret Seferović is an involved person under the Global Irregular
  Migration and Trafficking in Persons Sanctions Regulations 2025 as he is or has
  been involved in a relevant activity, namely people smuggling. By procuring the
  issuance of fraudulent passports, and with a view of obtaining any gain or benefit,
  Nusret Seferović engages in facilitating the unlawful entry into different countries
  of individuals, who are not nationals of those countries nor permanently resident
  in them.   \n"
