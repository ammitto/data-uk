uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nThe Tatmadaw has a track record of committing serious
  human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law in Myanmar
  for decades.\nAs Director of Dynasty International Company Ltd (DICL), Aung Moe
  Myint has used his commercial and personal position to provide support for these
  activities in his role as an importer and broker of arms and dual use goods. Through
  his control of DICL, he has acted as a key source of weapons and commercial support
  for the junta, including through his close political/commercial ties with Belarus.
  Aung Moe Myint has therefore been involved in the supply of restricted goods and/or
  restricted technology, and dual-use goods, which could have contributed to serious
  human rights violations.\nFurther, and/or alternatively, Dr Aung Moe Myint is associated
  with the State Administration Council and Myanmar Security Forces, through his role
  as Honorary Consul of the Republic of Belarus. He has used this position to carry
  out engagement on behalf of the State Administration Council and/or the Myanmar
  Security Forces. Further, and/or alternatively, Dr Aung Moe Myint is associated
  with the military through his extensive links with the former and current junta
  regimes.\n  \n"
