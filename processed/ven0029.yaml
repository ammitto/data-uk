  Amoroso has repeatedly undermined democracy in Venezuela, undermined the rule of law and violated the right to freedom of speech. By taking up his appointment as Comptroller General in contravention of a ruling by the legitimate National Assembly, and his role in setting up the non-recognised National Constituent Assembly (ANC), Amoroso has seriously undermined the democratic process, constitution, and democratic institutions in Venezuela. Additionally, while Second Vice President of the ANC, he contributed to the political persecution of opposition politicians Freddy Guevara and Juan Pablo Guanipa, further undermining democracy.
