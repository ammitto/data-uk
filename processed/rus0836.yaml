uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n State Councillor of the Russian Federation, 1st Class
  Ruslan Khadzhismelovich TSALIKOV is a Deputy Minister of Defence of the Armed Forces
  of the Russian Federation. He will have directed, or otherwise have had involvement
  in, responsibility for or influence over the deployment of troops involved in the
  Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that
  he is a person who is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes
  any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial
  integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. \n The trust services sanctions
  were imposed on 21/03/2023."
