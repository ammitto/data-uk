uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nValentin Aleksandrovich OPARIN is an involved person under
  the Global Human Rights (Sanctions) Regulations 2020 because he was responsible
  for the investigation of conduct which if carried out by or on behalf of a State
  within the territory of that State, would amount to a serious violation by that
  State of an individual’s right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman
  or degrading treatment or punishment, and intentionally or recklessly failed to
  fulfil that responsibility in relation to allegations that Oleg Senstov and Oleksandr
  Kolchenko were subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment whilst
  in custody in 2014 and 2015 respectively. \n"
