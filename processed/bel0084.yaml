  In his position as Prosecutor General of Belarus, Andrei Shved is responsible for the ongoing repression of civil society and democratic opposition, and in particular the launching of numerous criminal proceedings against peaceful demonstrators, opposition leaders and journalists in the wake of the 2020 presidential elections. He has also made public statements declaring participants in ‘unauthorised rallies’ to be terrorists and threatening them with punishment.
