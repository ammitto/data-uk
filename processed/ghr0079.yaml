  The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Public Security Bureau (XPCC PSB), is a state run organisation that administers security and policing for specific cities and sub-prefecture level areas across Xinjiang. The XPCC PSB is responsible for XPCC public security work in Xinjiang areas administered by the XPCC. Consequently, it is responsible for serious violations of the right not to be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or punishment, that have taken place in so called "training centres" in these areas.
