  There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Gholamreza SOLEIMANI has been involved in the commission of serious human rights violations in Iran, including being responsible for, engaging in and providing support for the violent suppression of protests in Iran through his role as Head of the “Volunteer Forces” (Basij Organisation) and through participating in decisions relating to the conduct of Iranian security forces during the 2019 protests via his position in the National Security Council.
