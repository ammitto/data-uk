  SHUVALOV (RUS0265), who has been designated by the UK since 3 March 2022, with whom
  she is closely associated and from whom she has obtained a financial benefit or
  other material benefit.\n Igor Ivanovich SHUVALOV is Chairman of the Management
  Board at Vnesheconombank (hereafter referred to as VEB.RF). VEB.RF is a state corporation
  established by the Government of Russia to function as the national development
  bank, and is owned or controlled directly by the Government of Russia. It is therefore
  a Government of Russia-affiliated entity. Therefore, as a result of his position

  or equivalent at a Government of Russia-affiliated entity, and is obtaining a benefit
  from or supporting the Government of Russia.  \n The trust services sanctions were
