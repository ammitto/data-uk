uk_statement_of_reasons: "\n Major General Vladimir Nikolaevich KUPRIYANYUK is the
  Chief of Staff of the Western Operational Command of the Belarus armed forces. There
  are reasonable grounds to suspect that he participated in joint exercises with the
  Russian military ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, he has been involved
  in engaging or providing support for policies and actions that destabilises Ukraine
  or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence
  of Ukraine. \n  \n The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023."
