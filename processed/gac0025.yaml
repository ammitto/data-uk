uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nAlex Nain Saab Moran engaged in serious corruption in
  Venezuela through his participation in two of Venezuela’s public programmes: the
  ‘Local Committees for Supply and Production’ (CLAP) and the Great Housing Scheme
  Venezuela (Spanish acronym: GMVV). In each case, contracts were improperly granted
  by public officials to companies owned or controlled by Saab Moran, for the benefit
  of the official(s) and/or for another person, including Saab Moran himself. In the
  CLAP programme, basic foodstuffs were provided at highly inflated prices. For GMVV,
  Saab Moran’s company only delivered a small proportion of the products they had
  agreed to deliver and for which it had been paid, misappropriating the remainder
  of the funds. \n"
