  This public ‘organisation’ presented candidates in the so called ‘elections’ of the so called ‘Luhansk People's Republic’ on 2nd November 2014. These ‘elections’ are in breach of Ukrainian law and therefore illegal. In participating formally in the illegal ‘elections’ it has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and to further destabilise Ukraine. This movement was headed by Igor PLOTNITSKY who is also subject to sanctions. The trust services sanctions were imposed on 21/03/2023.
