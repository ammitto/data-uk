  in Myanmar. He was appointed by the State Administration Council (SAC), following
  the February 2021 military coup. He is involved in undermining democracy through
  the manner of his appointment and his acceptance of the role. He is also undermining
  democracy and the rule of law by developing cases, widely regarded as unfounded,
  against democratically elected officials including Aung San Suu Kyi and President
  Win Myint.\n  \nFurther, U Tin Oo acts on behalf of, and/or at the direction of,
  and/or is associated with the SAC whose members are designated under the Myanmar
  (Sanctions) Regulations 2021.  \n  \nU Tin Oo was appointed by and reports to the
  Chair of the SAC, Commander-in-Chief, Min Aung Hlaing (designated under the Global
  Human Rights (Sanctions) Regulations 2020 and Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021)
  and is therefore associated with a designated person. \n \n"
