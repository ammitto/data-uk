uk_statement_of_reasons: "\nLuis Parra Rivero is a National Assembly Deputy (2021-2025)
  having been re-elected on 6 December 2020 in undemocratic parliamentary elections
  not recognised as free and fair by the UK. He was appointed Vice President of the
  National Assembly’s Permanent Commission on the Environment in January 2021. Parra
  Rivero had previously served as a National Assembly Deputy for the period 2016-2020.
  \n \nThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that Parra has been involved in undermining
  democracy in Venezuela by attempting to take office as NA President on 5 January
  2020 under an illegitimate process. The evidence indicates that Parra did not have
  the quorum for a session, the session was not moderated by the previous President
  of the National Assembly, and security forces blocked access to MPs that tried to
  enter the NA to participate in elections for a new National Assembly board.  \n
  \nThere are also reasonable grounds to suspect that Parra was involved with Operation
  Alacran, a scandal in which MPs were bribed, intimidated and coerced by the regime
  (or deputies co-opted by the regime) to not vote for opposition figurehead Juan
  Guaidó.  \n \nThere are lastly reasonable grounds to suspect that Parra has been
  involved in undermining democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela through his involvement
  in a corruption scandal related to the regime’s Committee of Supply and Demand (CLAP).
  \ \n \nThere are also reasonable grounds to suspect that Parra is associated with
  a person who is involved in undermining democracy in Venezuela (Nicolas Maduro),
  through aiding Maduro’s attacks on and attempts to control the National Assembly.
